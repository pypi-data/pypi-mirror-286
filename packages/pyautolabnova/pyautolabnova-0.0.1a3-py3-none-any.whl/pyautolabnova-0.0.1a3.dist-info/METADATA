See changelog for detailed changes for this release

This is a Python package for interfacing with Metrohm Autolab instruments. It provides a high-level API for controlling and data acquisition from Autolab potentiostats.

```
pip install pyautolabnova
```


## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Metrohm Autolab SDK 2.1 installed

## Usage
Please ensure the Autolab software is closed before using this package. Otherwise, you will encounter an 'Access Denied' error because the Autolab software maintains an exclusive lock on the USB device, preventing the Python script from accessing it through the SDK.


Here's a basic example of how to use PyAutolabNova:

```
from pyautolabnova.base import pyautolabnova as pal

pal.connect()
# Perform operations
pal.disconnect()
