**`skymavis_solver`** is a Python package designed to bypass CAPTCHA security verification used by Sky Mavis. This tool processes CAPTCHA images to determine if the challenge has been successfully bypassed.

### Features:

- **Specific to Sky Mavis CAPTCHA**: Works exclusively with Sky Mavis security verifications.
- **Image Zooming Required**: Ensure CAPTCHA images are properly zoomed in before processing for best results.

### Usage:

```python
from skymavis_solver import bypass_captcha

# Provide a properly zoomed CAPTCHA image
image_path = 'path/to/captcha_image.png'

# Process the CAPTCHA
result = bypass_captcha(image_path)

# Check the result
if result:
    print("CAPTCHA bypassed successfully!")
else:
    print("CAPTCHA not bypassed.")
