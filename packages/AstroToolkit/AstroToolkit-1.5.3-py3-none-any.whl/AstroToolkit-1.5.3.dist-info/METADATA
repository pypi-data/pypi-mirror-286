# AstroToolkit

AstroToolkit (ATK) is a set of tools for fetching, plotting, and analysing astronomical data.

## Features
- Proper motion correction through Gaia, utilised across the entire package
- Light curve, spectral energy distribution, spectrum and image queries from a wide range of surveys
- Gaia HRD queries for any Gaia sources
- In-built interactive plotting support for all of the above as shareable .html pages that retain all interactivity
- Data queries from any [Vizier](https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/) survey, with many commonly used surveys built-in
- Reddening queries from [Stilism](https://stilism.obspm.fr/) and [GDRE](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DUST/)
- Data analysis tools such as:
    - Timeseries analysis using a variety of methods (Lomb-Scargle, AOVMHW, ...)
    - Light curve binning, phase folding and sigma-clipping
    - Image detection and tracer overlays
    - Spectral band highlighting
    - SED-spectrum overlays
    - Data quality filtering (optional)
- Lossless saving and reading of any ATK data structures to / from local files
- 'Datapage' creation, allowing the combination of any of the above into a single page, with additional elements specifically designed for this purpose
- No hard coded parameters - built-in configuration support allows the user to personalise the Toolkit to their specific needs.
- Other quality-of-life tools, such as coordinate conversions, .fits file reading and [Vizier](https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/) / [SIMBAD](https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/) searches

Examples of much of the above can be found [here](#examples).

## Acknowledgements<a id='acknowledgements'></a>

I would like to give special thanks to Dr. Keith Inight for his guidance at various stages of the package's development, and particularly for his help in integrating the PyAOV time series analysis routines.










## Installation<a id="installation"></a>

The package can be installed like any other package, e.g. using pip:

```
pip install AstroToolkit
```

<br>

This package also includes the PyAOV time series analysis routines by [A. Schwarzenberg-Czerny](https://users.camk.edu.pl/alex/#software), which may require additional dependencies. Details are outlined [below](#setup).










## Introduction<a id="introduction"></a>

ATK uses Bokeh as its primary plotting library. The official documentation can be found at [https://bokeh.org/](https://bokeh.org/). A key property of Bokeh plots is that they can be saved as static .html files, which can then be shared/accessed while retaining all interactivity.

Across ATK, there are two possible ways to target your system of interest:
1. pos = [right ascension,declination] in degrees
2. source = Gaia Source ID

Where possible, it is usually best to use a Gaia source as input, as this enables a key feature of ATK: **Proper Motion Correction**.

A good example of this is in imaging queries. If a 'pos' is used as input, the result will simply be the image data returned by the chosen imaging survey at those exact coordinates. However, this may not be ideal in the case of an object with a large proper motion. If a source is used instead, the data returned will have accounted for this, resulting in the image being centered on the target system. This concept is used throughout ATK when matching data from different surveys to a given system.

### 1. query<a id="query"></a>

**Shortcuts:**
- [Data Query](#dataquery)
- [Photometry Query](#photquery)
- [Bulk Photometry Query](#bulkphotquery)
- [Light Curve Query](#lightcurvequery)
- [Image Query](#imagequery)
- [Spectrum Query](#spectrumquery)
- [SED Query](#sedquery)
- [HRD Query](#hrdquery)
- [Reddening Query](#reddeningquery)

**Usage:**

```
query(kind, *)
```

**Where:**


```
kind: str = kind of query to perform
            Can be one of:
             - 'data': return raw data from any Vizier catalogue
             - 'phot': return only photometry from any supported survey
             - 'bulkphot': return all available photometry from all supported surveys
             - 'lightcurve': return light curve data from any supported survey
             - 'image': return image data from any supported survey
             - 'spectrum': return spectrum data from any supported survey
             - 'sed': return spectral energy distribution data from all supported surveys
             - 'hrd': return Gaia Hertzsprung Russell Diagram data for a set of Gaia sources
             - 'reddening': return reddening data from any supported survey
```

**Note:**

**Each kind of query accepts/requires various other parameters.**

**If no data is returned in any kind of query, the *data* attribute will be set to None. In the specific case of light curve queries, which can return data for multiple bands, all parameters for any band that returns no data will be set to None.**

**The data returned by any kind of query can be saved to local files using the method *savedata()* on the returned class. Any data structure can also be printed in a readable format via the method *showdata()*.**

**The data returned by lightcurve, image, spectrum, sed and hrd queries can be plotted using the method *plot()* on the returned class. The resulting plot can then be shown using the method *showplot()* (which will also save the data locally) or just saved locally using the method *saveplot()*.**

**When saving data via the savedata(), saveplot() or showplot() methods, the default file name takes the form:**

**IDENTIFIER_SOURCE_SURVEY_ATKSUFFIX.EXTENSION**

**where:**

```
IDENTIFIER = JHHMMSS.SS±DDMMSS.SS coordinates of system
```

```
SOURCE = Gaia DR3 source_id
```

```
SURVEY = Survey from which data originates, where applicable (e.g. in SED queries, this is absent)
```

```
ATKSUFFIX = A suffix added to tell ATK what the data file holds. E.g. for lightcurves, ATKSUFFIX = ATKlightcurve
```

```
EXTENSION = File extension, e.g. .csv, .fits, etc.
```

If an entry is provided who's key is not the name of a supported survey, that entry will be interpreted as a custom entry. In this case, an additional 'values' key must be included, and the values/errors must be passed manually. For example:

```
selection: dict = custom datatable entry in the format

## AstroToolkit.Models<a id="models"></a>

This module allows for ATK features, such as plotting, saving and analysis, to be used with custom data by providing a set of empty (i.e. all attributes set to None) structures that ATK can use. These can then be filled with any relevant custom data.

**Note:** For information on the format that data should take in these structures, see the relevant [query](#query). In some cases it may not be necessary to provide information for every attribute of a structure. Once a structure has been filled with the necessary information in the correct format, ATK should treat it as if it were directly supported. 

### 1. CustomDataStruct

This provides an empty data structure used by data, phot, bulkphot and reddening queries.

**Usage:**

```
CustomDataStruct()
```

**Returns:** Empty ATK Data Structure

<br>

### 2. CustomLightcurveStruct

This provides an empty data structure used by light curve queries.

**Usage:**

```
CustomLightcurveStruct()
```

**Returns:** Empty ATK Lightcurve Structure

<br>

### 3. CustomImageStruct

This provides an empty data structure used by imaging queries.

**Usage:**

```
CustomImageStruct()
```

**Returns:** Empty ATK Image Structure

<br>

### 4. CustomHrdStruct

This provides an empty data structure used by HRD queries.

**Usage:**

```
CustomHrdStruct()
```

**Returns:** Empty ATK HRD Structure

<br>

### 5. CustomSedStruct

This provides an empty data structure used by sed queries.

**Usage:**

CustomSedStruct()
```

**Returns:** Empty ATK SED Structure

<br>

### 6. CustomSpectrumStruct

## AstroToolkit.Setup<a id="setup"></a>

This module helps with installing the PyAOV time series analysis tools.

### 1. PyAOV Guide<a id='tsguide'></a>

The guide to installing PyAOV and its pre-requisites can be shown using:

```
tsguide()
```

Your platform will be automatically detected. Passing platform='windows'/'linux' will override this and output the instructions for the chosen platform.










### 2. PyAOV Compilation<a id='tsbuild'></a>

As noted in the instructions in tsguide(), the required executables can be built using:

```
tsbuild()
```

This is only required on initial installation. Once the executables have been successfully built, PyAOV is ready to use.
