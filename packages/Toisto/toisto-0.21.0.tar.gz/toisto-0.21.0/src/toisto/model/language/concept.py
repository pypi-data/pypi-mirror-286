class Concept:
    """Class representing language concepts.

    A concept is either a composite or a leaf concept. Composite concepts have two or more constituent concepts,
    representing different grammatical categories, for example singular and plural forms. Leaf concepts have labels
    in different languages.

    Concepts can have following types of relations to other concepts:

    - The antonym relation is used to capture opposites. For example 'bad' has 'good' as antonym and 'good' has 'bad'
      as antonym.

    - The hypernym relation is used to capture "is a (kind of)" relations. Y is a hypernym of X if every X is a
      (kind of) Y. For example, canine is a hypernym of dog. The hypernym relation is transitive.

    - The holonym relation is used to capture "part of" relations. Y is a holonym of X if X is a part of Y.
      For example, sentences are holonym of words. The holonym relation is transitive.

    - The involves relation is used to link verbs with nouns.

    - The answer relation is used to specify possible answers to questions. Using the answer relation it is possible to
      specify that, for example, 'Do you like ice cream?' has the yes and no concepts as possible answers.

    - The examples relation is used to specify other concepts that exemplify the concept.

    - The roots relation is used to capture the relation between compound concepts and their roots. For example,
      the word 'blackboard' contains two roots, 'black' and 'board'. The concept for the compound concept refers to its
      roots with the roots attribute. The roots relation can also be used for sentences, in which case the individual
      words of a sentence are the roots. The roots relation is transitive.

      Note that this relationship is different from the other types of concept relations because the roots relationship
      is based on the label of the concept. It also means that the relationships can be different for different
      languages. For example, the Dutch label 'schoolbord' has different roots than the English equivalent 'blackboard'.

    NOTE: This class keeps track of the related concepts using their concept identifier (ConceptId) and only when
    the client asks for a concept is the concept instance looked up in the concept registry (Concept.instances). This
    prevents the need for a second pass after instantiating concepts from the concept files to create the relations.
