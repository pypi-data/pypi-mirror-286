`httpie-websockets` is an HTTPie CLI plugin that adds WebSocket support to the HTTPie command line.

## Features

- **WebSocket Support:** Seamlessly connect to WebSocket servers using the familiar HTTPie command line interface.
- **Bidirectional Communication:** Send and receive messages in real-time.
- **Secure Connections:** Supports both `ws://` and `wss://` protocols.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple installation and usage within the HTTPie environment.

You can install by httpie plugins command:

```shell
