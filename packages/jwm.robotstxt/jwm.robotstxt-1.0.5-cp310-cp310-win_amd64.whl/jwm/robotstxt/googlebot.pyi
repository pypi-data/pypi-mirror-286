"""
This file implements the standard defined by the Robots Exclusion Protocol
(REP) internet draft (I-D).
  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9309.html

Google doesn't follow the standard strictly, because there are a lot of
non-conforming robots.txt files out there, and we err on the side of
disallowing when this seems intended.

An more user-friendly description of how Google handles robots.txt can be
found at:
  https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/robots_txt

This library provides a low-level parser for robots.txt (ParseRobotsTxt()),
and a matcher for URLs against a robots.txt (class RobotsMatcher).

class RobotsMatcher(RobotsParseHandler):

    RobotsMatcher - matches robots.txt against URLs.

    The Matcher uses a default match strategy for Allow/Disallow patterns which
    is the official way of Google crawler to match robots.txt. It is also
    possible to provide a custom match strategy.

    The entry point for the user is to call one of the *AllowedByRobots()
    methods that return directly if a URL is being allowed according to the
    robots.txt and the crawl agent.
    The RobotsMatcher can be re-used for URLs/robots.txt but is not thread-safe.

    def __init__(self, /) -> None:
        """
        Create a RobotsMatcher with the default matching strategy. The default
        matching strategy is longest-match as opposed to the former internet draft
        that provisioned first-match strategy. Analysis shows that longest-match,
        while more restrictive for crawlers, is what webmasters assume when writing
        directives. For example, in case of conflicting matches (both Allow and
        Disallow), the longest match is the one the user wants. For example, in
        case of a robots.txt file that has the following rules
          Allow: /
          Disallow: /cgi-bin
        it's pretty obvious what the webmaster wants: they want to allow crawl of
        every URI except /cgi-bin. However, according to the expired internet
        standard, crawlers should be allowed to crawl everything with such a rule.
