## Modulos Client Tool

This tool provides a command-line interface to interact with the Modulos platform.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Setuptools and wheels:

```
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

- Install dependencies:

```
pip install modulos-client
```

### Usage

#### Logging In

To login to the Modulos platform:

```bash
modulos login --host [HOST_URL] --token [TOKEN] --profile-name [PROFILE_NAME]
```

- `[HOST]` is the address of the platform. For local use, this would typically be `http://localhost`.
- `[TOKEN]` is your authentication token.
- `[PROFILE_NAME]` is the name of the profile. It is used to reference the profile in the future. If you want to use multiple profiles, you can specify a different name for each profile.

#### Logging Out

To logout from the Modulos platform:

```bash
modulos logout
```

This will remove all profiles and locally stored data.

#### List profiles

List all profiles:

```bash
modulos profiles list
```

#### Profile activation

Activate a profile:

```bash
modulos profiles activate --profile-name [PROFILE_NAME]
```

This is useful if you have multiple profiles and want to switch between them.
Listing them will show you the currently active profile.

#### Deactivate a profile

With

```bash
modulos profiles deactivate --profile-name [PROFILE_NAME]
```

you can remove a profile.
The last currently used profile will be activated automatically.

#### Managing Organizations

In order to use the `modulos orgs` commands, you need to have superadmin permissions.

List all organizations:

```bash
modulos orgs list
```

Create a new organization:

```bash
modulos orgs create --name [ORG_NAME]
```

#### Managing Organization Configurations

In order to use the `modulos config-organizations` commands, you need to have superadmin permissions.

Obtain the configuration of an organisation.

```bash
modulos config-organizations get [--organization-id [ORGANIZATION_ID]]
```

> There is an optional `--organization-id` parameter to specify the organization you want to get.
> If you do not specify it, the organization you are currently logged into will be returned.
> If you want to get the configuration for a different organization, you need to have super administrator permissions.

Update configurations for an organization.

```bash
modulos config-organizations update --organization-id [ORGANIZATION_ID] --quota-projects [NUMBER_OF_PROJECTS_ALLOWED]
```

#### Managing Users

List all users:

```bash
modulos users list
```

Create a new user:

```bash
modulos users create --firstname [FIRST_NAME] --lastname [LAST_NAME] --email [EMAIL] --is-active [IS_ACTIVE] --is-org-admin [IS_ORG_ADMIN]
```

> There is an optional `--organization-id` parameter to specify the organization the user should be created for.
> If you don't specify it, the user will be created for the organization you are currently logged in to.
> If the user should be created for a different organization, you need to have superadmin permissions.
> For a user in the same organization, you need to have org admin permissions.

Add organization admin privileges to a user:

```bash
modulos users add-org-admin --user-id [USER_ID]
```

Remove organization administrator privileges from a user:

```bash
modulos users remove-org-admin --user-id [USER_ID]
```

#### Managing Projects

List all projects:

```bash
modulos projects list --page [PAGE_NUMBER]
```

Delete a project:

```bash
modulos projects delete --id [PROJECT_ID]
```

You need to have the `project.delete` permission for the project.

#### Managing Templates

List all templates:

```bash
modulos templates list
```

Upload templates for your organization:

```bash
modulos templates upload --file [FILE_PATH]
```

> There is an optional `--organization-id` parameter to specify the organization the template should be uploaded for.
> If you don't specify it, the template will be uploaded for the organization you are currently logged in to.
> If the template should be uploaded for a different organization, you need to have superadmin permissions.
