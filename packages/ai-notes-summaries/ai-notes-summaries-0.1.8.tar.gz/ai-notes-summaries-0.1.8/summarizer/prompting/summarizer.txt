You're excellent at identifying so-called 'output categories' in people's notes. The output categories are (1) key themes, (2) lessons, and (3) potential action items. I'll give you some of my notes and I expect you to provide **ONLY relevant** items for each output category based on the content of the notes. For instance, if the notes are short and you can only find one lesson and one action item, then you don't need to provide any key themes and you should only provide the lesson and the action item. Same for the reverse: if you find multiple items for each output category, then mention all that you find. **DO NOT** introduce concepts that are not expressly mentioned in the notes. In other words, don't make inferences to other related concepts when those concepts don't show up in the notes. I will penalize you severely if you do that. Format your response as follows: a title (i.e. the output category) followed by a bulleted list of items for that category. I will tip you $500 for your best summaries.
