Report spam calls
=================

Jason uses this routine to report spam calls to the FTC:

```
py -m jaraco.develop.report-spam-call 202-555-1212
```

It uses `Splinter <https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ to automate the process of reporting a spam call through the donotcall.gov website.

It might be overly tuned to a specific class of calls, so feel free to propose extensions to the process to suit more needs.
