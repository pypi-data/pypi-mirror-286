    specified in a BitArrayShape and (optionally) the indices of the variable in every dimension. Here, a single number
    for a particular dimension means the index of the variable with the specified numbers in the dimensions is
    included in the one-way-one-hot group. Another possibility is to specify a list or a range of indices for each dimension in
    order to include all indices of the variables with these specified numbers in the dimensions in the one-way-one-hot group.

    a sequence of disjoint named sections over this linear structure. Bits within a section can be addressed by the
    defined name. With a ``BitArrayShape`` a section can be defined as multidimensional array and single bits in the
    section can be addressed by an appropriate tuple of indices. With a ``Variable`` definition the section represents
    a number encoded in certain bit schemes; in this case it is possible to retrieve the represented value instead of
    reading single bits.

class PartialConfig(BaseModel):
    """:class:`PartialConfig` produces a dictionary that can be used to initialize bits for the annealing algorithm.

    The start state for an annealing or parallel tempering optimization can be specified.
    The used dictionary addresses bits with their flattened index. With the class
    :class:`PartialConfig` those bits can be specified on the symbolic level of
    :class:`BitArrayShape` or :class:`Variable` and the offsets in a :class:`VarShapeSet` are calculated automatically.
    Flat indices can be used directly, if they are known. For variables, indices are used directly and do not need
    to be adjusted by a global index consideration from the :class:`VarShapeSet`. After setting the start state accordingly,
    a string can be created with the method ``as_json``. If one_hot or two_hot specifications are given in :class:`VarShapeSet`, the dictionary
    generated in the methods ``get_dict`` or ``as_json`` is build up with respect to the set bit variables and one-way or two-way rules.

    The object is initialized by a :class:`VarShapeSet` object or None. An initialization with None can be used for :class:`BinPol`.
