# Nylas API v2 (Legacy) Python bindings

Python bindings for the Nylas API v2.

The Nylas APIs power applications with email, calendar, and contacts CRUD and bi-directional sync from any inbox in the world.

Nylas is compatible with 100% of email service providers, so you only have to integrate once.
No more headaches building unique integrations against archaic and outdated IMAP and SMTP protocols.
