# Data Aquisition and Handling

This package provides methods to access a set of devices over 1-wire, SPI, or I2C bus from a Raspberry Pi.
 * DS18B20
 * MCP23S17
 * MCP3208
 * MCP4922
 * PCF8574

It is intended for use in the Edinburgh University course **Data Acquisition and Handling** but should work for any Raspberry Pi with the Raspbian OS installed.

NB: there's a difference between the GPIO pin handling with the RPi 5 compared to earlier boards. This code is updated for the RPi 5, and not guaranteed to work with earlier boards.

Replacement for [webiopi](http://webiopi.trouch.com/)
