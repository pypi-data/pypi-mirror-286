<h1 align="center">xonv: Extended convolutional layers</h1>

This repository contains the code for extended convolutional layers.
These layers are akin to the convolutional layers in PyTorch, but with
the key difference that they have spatially varying kernels.

Since the kernels are spatially varying, the convolutional layers in
this repository offer more expressive power than the standard
convolutional layers while still having $\mathcal{O}(n)$ parameters,
where $n$ is the input size. The implementation is based on
matrix-vector products, which allows for scalable training and inference
on GPUs.

Below is a comparison between the toeplitz-like matrix associated with a
regular convolutional layer vs the extended convolutional layer
(`xonv`):

## Installation


Run the command below to install the package to be used in your Python environment.

```bash
pip install xonv
```

For further development and to run the examples, clone the repository
and install the package in editable mode. **Make sure to adapt the
hardcoded CUDA version in `setup.cfg` to the one installed on your system.**

```bash
# Create a new conda environment.
conda create --name xonv python
conda activate xonv

# Clone the repository and install the package in editable mode.
git clone ttps://github.com/alisiahkoohi/xonv
cd xonv/
pip install -e .
```



## Usage

The extended convolutional layers can be used as a drop-in replacement
for the PyTorch convolutional layers. The following example demonstrates
how to use the extended convolutional layers:

```python
from xonv.layer import Xonv2D

input_size = (32, 32)  # Height, Width of input
in_channels = 3
out_channels = 16
kernel_size = 3
stride = 2

layer = Xonv2D(
    in_channels,
    out_channels,
    kernel_size,
    input_size,
    stride=stride,
)

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, in_channels, *input_size)
output = layer(input_tensor)

print(layer)  # Xonv2D(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, input_size=(32, 32), stride=2)
print(output.shape)  # Should be [1, 16, 16, 16]
```

## Examples

To visualize the toeplitz-like matrix associated with the convolutional layer, run the following command:

```bash
python scripts/create_toeplitz_like_matrix.py
```
