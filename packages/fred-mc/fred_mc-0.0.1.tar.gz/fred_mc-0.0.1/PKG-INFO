FRED-mc repository
==================

FRED (Fast paRticle thErapy Dose evaluator) is a fast Monte-Carlo platform for particle transport in heterogeneous media. The main motivation is to allow a rapid recalculation of dose deposition in the context of Particle Therapy. FRED can transport protons, light ions, neutrons and other particles through voxelized regions. A complete treatment plan can be recalculated importing patient data (e.g. CT scans) and delivery plans (namely fields and pencil beams).

FRED can run on CPU hardware exploiting multi-core parallelism as well as on single or multiple GPU cards using OpenCL.

Documentation and tutorial
