User guide
==========

This guide will walk you through Olympe API using a series of examples that increasingly demonstrate
more advanced usage.

Before continuing you should first read the Olympe :ref:`installation procedure<installation>`.

For your own safety and the safety of others, the following examples will use a simulated ANAFI
drone but remember that Olympe is also capable of communicating with a physical drone. As far as
Olympe is concerned, the main difference between a physical and a simulated drone is the drone IP
address network.


The full code of each example can be found in the
`src/olympe/doc/examples/ <https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/olympe/tree/master/src/olympe/doc/examples>`_
folder.
