# REDCap Language Library Translator

## Overview

The REDCap Language Library Translator is a Python script designed to translate the "default" values in a REDCap JSON file  into a user-defined language using the Google Translate API. The script handles large text translations by breaking them into manageable chunks and also manages translation errors by logging them into a separate file.

## Features

- **Language Support:** Translates "default" values into a wide range of languages.
- **Chunk Processing:** Handles large texts by breaking them into smaller chunks.
- **Error Handling:** Logs any translation errors into a separate file.
- **JSON Key Updates:** Updates the `display` and `key` fields in the JSON file to reflect the new language.

# REDCap Language Library Translator

## How It Works

### User Input:
- The script prompts the user to select the JSON file using a graphical file dialog.
- The user specifies the target language for translation.

### Extract Default Values:
- The script extracts all "default" and "translation" values from the JSON file.

### Create Subfolder:
- A subfolder is created based on the version of the JSON file and the target language.

### Save Extracted Data:
- The extracted data is saved into a new JSON file within the subfolder.

### Translate Values:
- The script translates the "default" values in the new JSON file.
- If any translation errors occur, the corresponding key-value pairs are logged into a separate "errors" file.

### Update Original JSON:
- The script updates the original JSON file with the new translated values.
- The display and key fields are updated to reflect the new language.

### Cleanup:
- The temporary translation file is deleted.


### Error Handling
If any errors occur during the translation process, the script logs the corresponding key-value pairs into a separate file named {language}_Error.log within the subfolder. This allows users to review and address translation issues separately.
