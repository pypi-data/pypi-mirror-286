[mVISTA](https://genome.lbl.gov/vista/mvista/submit.shtml) is a popular web-based tool for multi-species sequence conservation analyses, and as it is particularly sensitive it can be used to identify conserved non-coding elements. Especially for the analysis of intergenic sequences, mVISTA requires two types of files as inputs from each species: the relevant DNA sequence in FASTA format, and an [annotation file in pipmaker format](https://genome.lbl.gov/vista/mvista/instructions.shtml#anno) that contains the _relative_ sequence coordinates of the features (UTRs and exons) of any genes in the sequence. \
\
The reccommended way (and only way as far as I know) to get these paired sequence and annotation files is to use the [Ensembl genome browser](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html) website interface to navigate to your region of interest, then export and save the two files. This works well, but is quite time-consuming and fiddly to go through all the steps. The Ensembl genome browser also only contains a fraction of the sequenced genome that exist in other databases e.g. NCBI's GenBank, which limits the species it's possible to actually use in the mVISTA analyses (with an annotation file). \
\
I created this package to address these issues, providing a fast and user-friendly way to obtain pairs of sequence and annotation files from the command line. **No coding knowledge is required to use it!** \
\
After installing the package, you can use the four main modules (engene, gbgene, encoords, gbcoords) to search either the Ensembl genome browser database or the GenBank database for sequences by gene name or genomic coordinates, and even perform more advanced operations such as obtaining gene sequences with specific flanking sequences, including by specifying upstream or downstream genes that should represent the region boundaries. Relevant information is printed to the terminal, including simple visualisations, and the FASTA and pipmaker files are saved as .txt files in your working directory. With as little as a single command and a matter of seconds, you can easily obtain homologous sequence regions from multiple species that are ready to upload to the mVISTA web interface.

## engene inputs:
## -s, -g, and -autoname
The simplest inputs are the species name (**-s**) and gene name (**-g**), along with the **-autoname** flag:
```
$ engene -s human -g gdf5 -autoname
```
This produces the following output in the terminal:
```

The gene name must be the Ensembl-recognised gene symbol, with very little wiggle room for synonyms (e.g. nkx3.2 or nkx3-2 works). Alternatively, the Ensembl gene ID can be searched for e.g. ENSCMIG00000008841.
The species name also has to be entered in a form recognised by Ensembl, which includes binomial and one-word common names. For species with multi-word species names such as Spotted Gar, the binomial name must be used with an underscore i.e. Lepisosteus_oculatus. Multiple species names can be entered, not just one, as will be explained later in this document. The **enspecies** module makes finding binomial names of species in the Ensembl database easy, as will be explained later in this document.

Two text files are generated in the working directory - the first contains the coordinates of the exons and UTRs of all genes contained within the genomic region selected in pipmaker format, and the second contains the DNA sequence of the selected region in fasta format. By using the **-autoname** flag, the names of these files were automatically generated from the species and gene name inputs.

## -anno and -fasta
Alternatively, the output file names can be specified manually using the **-anno** and **-fasta** arguments, e.g:
```
$ engene -s human -g gdf5 -fasta fastafilename -anno annotationfilename

Without **-anno**, **-fasta**, or **-autoname** arguments, the terminal output will be provided but no output .txt files will be saved to the working directory. This can be useful for quickly testing a set of arguments without cluttering up your working directory with test output files.

## -sa and -ea
Two additional arguments can be used to adjust the start (**-sa**) and end (**-ea**) coordinates beyond the gene start and end. For example, to extract the sequence and annotations for the human gdf5 gene plus an additional 50,000bp from the 5' flank and an additional 20,000bp from the 3' flank (strand direction relative to the assembly, NOT the gene):
```
$ engene -s human -g gdf5 -autoname -sa 50000 -ea 20000 

▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒

In the output, note that the gene length is 21,400bp, but the total sequence length extracted is 91,400bp as a result of the 70,000bp flanking regions also being included. The automatically generated output file names also now include the new genomic coordinates. The annotation file also reflects these additional sequences, including the gene transcripts in the expanded region:

```
## -goa
By default, when using **-sa** or **-ea**, these adjustments are done according to the assembly direction, regardless of the gene orientation. For example **-sa 1000** adds 1000bp from the 'left' of the specified gene, even if this is 'downstream' because when the gene is on the reverse strand. However, if you want to collect 1000bp from 'in front' of the gene (e.g. for collecting promoter sequences), you can use **-sa 1000** in combination with **-goa**. By adding the **-goa** argument to the command, the module ensures the 1000bp are always added 'upstream' of the gene (and vice-versa when using **-ea**).

## -nocut
By default, the module carefully trims the transcript coordinates to ensure that the reported coordinates fit inside the specified region and only features inside the region are included. In this case, the specified coordinate range cut off 80,769bp from the UQCC1 gene-205 transcript, and 44,534bp has been cut off the CEP250-205, and this information about the truncation has been added to the transcript names to make it clear to the user that the selection has cut off part of these transcripts.
This option can be turned off by including the **-nocut** flag, such that cut-off parts of the transcripts are still included in the annotation file, with negative coordinates or coordinates that extend beyond the end the sequence:
```
$ engene -s human -g gdf5 -autoname -sa 50000 -ea 20000 -nocut
```
produces the following text in the annotation file:

Bear in mind that this file won't work as an input to mVISTA, because the annotation coordinates have to match the fasta file and having negative coordinates or coordinates greater than the total sequence length will result in an error. However, this option can be useful to see the number of features that are cut off in the default output. It's worth noting that the results using the **-nocut** option match the output you get from using the Ensembl website's export data tool, which then often has to be manually curated to fit the sequence in order for the mVISTA analysis to run successfully. In this regard, the default mode of this module (without **-nocut**) represents another incentive to use the GetVISTA package as opposed to Ensembl website interface.

## -vis
When the **-vis** flag is included in the command, a simple graphical representation of the specified sequence region is printed in the terminal:
```
$ engene -s human -g gdf5 -sa 50000 -ea 20000 -vis

Here, the transcripts in the region are printed with their strand directions indicated by the flanking '>' or '<' symbols while the '=' symbols represent intergenic sequences. Partially overlapping transcripts, such as GDF5-AS-1 and GDF5-201, are shown by the presence of the '#' symbol between the two names. The lengths of the displayed intergenic sequences are approximately accurate, while genes are only represented by their printed names, regardless of size.

## -all
By default, only the exon and UTR coordinates of the canonical gene transcripts are included in the annotation .txt file, e.g:
```
< 1 4882 GDF5-201
1 562 UTR
563 1437 exon
3952 4582 exon
4583 4882 UTR
```
However, by including the **-all** flag in the command, all transcripts are included, including the non-canonical ones, e.g:
```
< 1 4882 GDF5-201
1 562 UTR
563 1437 exon
3952 4582 exon
4583 4882 UTR

< 1 21400 GDF5-202
1 562 UTR
563 1437 exon
3952 4582 exon
4583 4823 UTR
7886 8041 UTR
21294 21400 UTR
```
## -rev
Also by default, the specified genomic region is read on the genome assembly's forward strand, but for some purposes, a gene on the reverse strand may want to be collected in the 5'>3' direction (or indeed vice versa). In such cases, the **-rev** flag can be included. This reverse complements the DNA sequence returned in the fasta file (in addition to modifying the header to reflect this by changing :1 to :-1). It also flips the annotation coordinates. We have already seen that the human GDF5 gene is on the reverse strand (indicated by left-facing '<' in the annotation file), so using the **-rev** argument:
```
$ engene -s human -g gdf5 -autoname -rev              
```
Produces this output in the terminal:
```

The automatically generated output file names reflect the fact that the sequence and annotation coordinates have been reversed, the coordinates looking like this:
```

```
## -fw and multi-species entry
Instead of manually reversing of the strand direction, the **-fw** argument forces the use of the forward strand for the specified gene. For example, if you know you always want your target gene to be on the forward strand, you can add the **-fw** argument every time, because if the target gene is already on the forward strand, it won't reverse the direction, but if it's on the reverse strand, it will.

Crucially, multiple species names can be included as arguments with **-s**, for example:
```
$ engene -s human mouse chicken -g gdf5 -autoname -sa 50000 -ea 20000 -fw
```
In this case, the module behaves as previously described, just iterating through the different species names (separated by spaces). As a result, in this example the 6 output files from all 3 species will be saved in the working directory, and the output in the terminal looks like this:
```

The inclusion of the **-fw** argument caused the human and mouse, but not chicken, strand directions to be automatically flipped such that in all 3 species, Gdf5 is output in the same (forward) strand. This is particularly useful in conjunction with the input of multiple species, as the same gene will often be annotated on different strands in assemblies from different species, and for sequence alignment a common orientation is essential. \
Note that if the module fails for any species entry in the list (e.g. because of a mispelling in the species name or being unable to find a gene by that name in the specified species), the module will continue to process the other species, and at the end tell you which species failed.
## -flank
Finally, the last option for specifying the sequence region is **-flank**. Adding this argument causes the module to pause after printing the list of genes in the specified sequence region, and prompts the user to input two gene names from this list. These two genes are then used to define the boundaries of a new sequence region, whereupon the module reruns to extract the feature coordinates and fasta sequence corresponding to this new region. **-flank** can be used in two modes: **-flank in** includes the two genes within the boundaries, such that the new sequence begins at the first base of the first gene and ends at the last base of the second gene (read left to right along the forward strand), while **-flank ex** excludes these genes, such that the new sequence begins immediately after the first gene, and ends immediately before the second gene. For example, imagine engene is run with Gene C as an input and **-sa 100000 -ea 100000** so the region includes Gene A, Gene B, Gene C, Gene D, and Gene E. When the **-flank in** argument is included and Gene B and Gene D are entered at the prompts, the new sequence includes just Genes B, C, and D, and the two intergenic sequences between them. On the other hand, when the **-flank ex** argument is used and Gene B and Gene D are entered at the prompts, the new sequence only includes Gene C and the intergenic sequences on either side of it, right up until the 3' end of Gene B and 5' end of Gene D.

This command functions almost identically to engene, except that it queries the GenBank nucleotide database rather than Ensembl. There is no **-all** option, as all transcripts are automatically included in the annotation file. However, this only includes the manually curated transcripts. To get all transcripts including the predicted ones, add the **-x** flag. This may be particularly relevant when exploring new genomes with few manually curated genes/transcripts. If no manually curated features are found in the region, the module will automatically try to look for the predicted ones. There is also an extra option **-r**, to specify the sequence record. By default it is 0 (the default record according to GenBank), but a different record may be desired in some cases (e.g. to use the human T2T assembly CHM13v2.0 instead of the GRCh38.14 assembly - see the gbrecords module description below). \
Unlike in engene, the species name can be entered in any form with underscores separating the words (e.g. carcharodon_carcharias or great_white_shark). Also unlike engene, a wide variety of gene synonyms can be searched for rather than the specific or canonical gene symbol. It's important to be aware of this - for example, if you search for the zebrafish _shh_ gene. In this case, as a result of the teleost whole-genome duplication, zebrafish possess two paralogs of shh: _shha_ and _shhb_, but the result will be the _shha_ gene only, because _shh_ is listed as one of its synonyms while it isn't for _shhb_. \
You can also search for genes using refseq transcript or protein IDs (e.g. NM_008109.4 or NP_032135.2), but be aware that the species associated with these IDs will take precedence over the species given as an argument in **-s**. For example, NM_008109.4 is from the mouse genome, so even if the command given is **-s human -g NM_008109.4**, the result will be the mouse gene, so be careful to check the "Organism" line that gets printed in the terminal to be sure (see <<< below):
```

The encoords module works similarly to engene, but with some critical differences as the intention is to query a set of genomic coordinates instead of a gene name. Therefore, the **-g** argument is replaced by **-c**, and the coordinates are entered in the format 'chromosome:start-end' e.g:
```

As the coordinates are specified in place of the gene name, the **-sa**, **-ea**, **-goa**, and **-fw** arguments in engene are absent from encoords. However, the **-goo** in some ways takes the place of **-goa**, as it prompts you to enter a gene name from the genes found in the specified region that you would like to specify should be in the forward direction. Also, as the chromosomes and coordinates are not homologous between species, there is no option to enter multiple species names as in engene.

                        genes, 'ex' to exclude them

```
This command functions almost identically to encoords, except that it queries the GenBank nucleotide database rather than Ensembl so has aspects of gbcoords (the absence of the **-all** argument, replaced in a sense by **-x**). The other key difference with encoords is that an accession code (e.g. NC_000020 for human chromosome 20 in GRCh38.p14) must be specified with **-a** instead of a species name with **-s**, and the genomic coordinates therefore just require the base region, not the chromosome (e.g. 500000-600000 instead of 20:500000-600000):
```
$ gbcoords -a NC_000020 -c 500000-600000
```

# enspecies usage
```
$ enspecies -h
usage: enspecies [-h] [-cn COMMON_NAME] [-ln LATIN_NAME] [-tax TAXON]

List species names from the Ensembl genome browser database by common name, latin binomial name, or taxon.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -cn COMMON_NAME, --common_name COMMON_NAME
                        Search for species by their common name or part of it (e.g. fly)
  -ln LATIN_NAME, --latin_name LATIN_NAME
                        Search for species by their latin binomial names or part of it 
                        (e.g. melano)
  -tax TAXON, --taxon TAXON
                        Search for species by taxon name (e.g. Carnivora)
```
This accessory module is intended to be used to quickly retrieve the latin binomial names of species in the Ensembl genome browser database, and also to search for species in the database by taxon.
For example, if you want to search for the latin names of the 'flycatcher' by this common name, use **-cn**:
```
$ enspecies -cn flycatcher

List of Matching Species in Ensembl:
Collared flycatcher -> ficedula_albicollis
```
In the same way, you can search for any species that contain the string of letters "fly" in their name: 
```
$ enspecies -cn fly

List of Matching Species in Ensembl:
Collared flycatcher -> ficedula_albicollis
Fruit fly -----------> drosophila_melanogaster
large flying fox ----> pteropus_vampyrus
```
If you mispell a name, the module returns the closest matches to the query. For example, if 'whale' is mispelled as 'while':
```
$ enspecies -cn while

Finding up to 3 closest matches:
sperm whale --> physeter_catodon
Blue whale ---> balaenoptera_musculus
beluga whale -> delphinapterus_leucas
```

If you prefer to search by a string of letters in the latin binomial name, use **-ln**:
```
$ enspecies -ln melano

List of Matching Species in Ensembl:
Fruit fly ---> drosophila_melanogaster
giant panda -> ailuropoda_melanoleuca
round goby --> neogobius_melanostomus
silver-eye --> zosterops_lateralis_melanops
```

Finally, you can search the Ensembl genome browser database for all species contained within a taxon using **-tax**. This can take a few seconds to run, especially for large taxa, and the taxon name must be spelled correctly. For example:
```
$ enspecies -tax felidae

List of Species in Ensembl:
Canada lynx -> lynx_canadensis
Cat ---------> felis_catus
Leopard -----> panthera_pardus
Lion --------> panthera_leo
Tiger -------> panthera_tigris_altaica

 5 species records in felidae
```
In all these cases, the bionomial name on the right can be used as the species input for the engene or encoords modules.

# gbrecords usage
```
$ gbrecord -h
usage: gbrecord [-h] -s SPECIES -g GENE_NAME

Query the GenBank database with a species and gene name to obtain a list of different 
records containing the sequence to inform the use of the gbgene module.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SPECIES, --species SPECIES
                        Species name (e.g., 'Homo_sapiens' or 'Human')
  -g GENE_NAME, --gene_name GENE_NAME
                        Gene name (e.g. BRCA1 or brca1)
```
This accessory module is intended to be used to see which genomic sequence records are available in GenBank for the given species and gene name. For example:
```
$ gbrecord -s human -g gdf5
```
gives this output in the terminal:
```
RECORD 0
Assembly: Chromosome 20 Reference GRCh38.p14 Primary Assembly
Accession: NC_000020
Location: 35433346:35454748
Length: 21403

RECORD 1
Assembly: RefSeqGene
Accession: NG_008076
Location: 21518:26399
Length: 4882

RECORD 2
Assembly: Chromosome 20 Alternate T2T-CHM13v2.0
Accession: NC_060944
Location: 37154207:37175639
Length: 21433
```
This shows that there are 3 different genomic records readily available in GenBank that contain the human GDF5 gene. Record 0 and Record 2 are different genomic assemblies, while Record 1 is a smaller RefSeqGene sequence (28kb). The transcript of GDF5 contained in this sequence is one of the shorter isoforms, only 4882bp as opposed to the longer 21403bp isoform in GRCh38.p14 or 21433bp isoform in CHM13v2.0. If you were only interested in the isolated region around the smaller core sequence of GDF5, you may want to use **-r 1** when running the gbgene command. This would also slightly speed up the request compared to using the default (**-r 0**) GRCh38.p14 record which is larger.

# gbemail usage
```
$ gbemail -h
usage: gbemail [-h] [-check] [-update]

Manage email address for GenBank Entrez queries. Only stored locally and sent with 
queries to NCBI, nowhere else.

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -check      Check the current saved email address
  -update     Update the email address
```
The first time you try to run gbgene, gbcoords, or gbrecord, you will be prompted for an email address as NCBI requires this to send queries via Entrez. After you enter this email address the first time, you won't need to enter it again, as it saved locally to a config file in the package directory. It is never shared with anyone except NCBI when you send queries via Entrez. This accessory module provides the option to check or update (change) this email address if you decide to use a different address at a later date. Any dummy email address or word (e.g. 'dummy@gmail.com' or 'dummy') can also be used if preferred.

## Notes
* Per the [Ensembl REST API documentation](https://rest.ensembl.org/documentation/info/overlap_region), the maximum sequence length that can be queried with engene or encoords is 5Mb. Requests above this limit will fail.
* Requests to GenBank with gbgene, gbcoords, or gbrecord sometimes fail for reasons unknown. If you get an "HTTP Error 400: Bad Request" when running gbcoords or gbrecord, or a failure with no information when running gbgene, try running the command once or twice again, and the query should go through.
* I have performed most testing of the gb scripts using vertebrates with unambiguous gene symbols. They seem to work well with species and genes with curated genomes, but I cannot guarantee it will work with other types of records.
* In the graphical representation, if two or more gene transcripts have identical start and end coordinates, only one of the transcripts will be visualised.
