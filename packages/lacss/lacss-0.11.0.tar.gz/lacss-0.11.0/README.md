## LACSS

_LACSS is a deep-learning model for single-cell segmentation from microscopy images._

### Installation
```
pip install lacss
```
For more details, see [documentation](https://jiyuuchc.github.io/lacss/install/)

### Why LACSS?
LACSS is designed to utilize point labels for model training. You have three options:

| Method | Data(left) / Label(right)|
| --- | --- |
| Point | <img src="https://github.com/jiyuuchc/lacss/raw/main-jax/.github/images/label_scheme_1.png" width="300"> |
| Point + Mask | <img src="https://github.com/jiyuuchc/lacss/raw/main-jax/.github/images/label_scheme_2.png" width="300"> |
| Segmentation | <img src="https://github.com/jiyuuchc/lacss/raw/main-jax/.github/images/label_scheme_3.png" width="300"> |

You can of course also combined these labels in any way you want.

### What is included?

- A library for training LACSS model and performing inference
- A few pretrained models as transfer learning starting point
- SMC-based cell tracking utility for people interested in cell tracking

### How to generate point label?

If your data include nuclei counter-stain, the easist way to generate point label for your image is to use a [blob detection](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_blob.html) algorithm on the nuclei images:
