properties:

  # Each of these automatically add two EPICS PVs:
  #  - (prefix):(property)_VAL: setter variable
  #  - (prefix):(property)_RBV: getter variable (read-back value)

  # advanced triggering mode enable:
  # ADVT 0 turns off
  # ADVT 1 turns on
  - property: "ADVT"
    kind: "analog"

  # prescale factor:
  # PRES i, j
  # for channels i, the prescale factor is set to j
  # i = 0 is trigger input, 1 is output AB, ...
  - property: "PRES"
    kind: "analog"

  # external trigger level
  # TLVL v
  - property: "TLVL"
    kind: "analog"

  # external trigger source:
  # TSRC i
  # i = 0 internal, 1 external rising, 2 external falling
  - property: "TSRC"
    kind: "analog"

  # set internal trigger rate:
  # TRAT f (in Hz)
  - property: "TRAT"
    kind: "analog"

  # delay
  # DLAY c, d, t
  # set delay of channel c relative to channel d to value t
  # DLAY 2,0,10e-6 sets delay of channel A to T0 + 10e-6 s
  # 0 = T0, 1 =  T1, 2 = A, 3 = B, 4 = C, 5 = D, 6 = E, 7 = F, 8 = G, 9 = H
  - property: "DLAY"
    kind: "analog"

  # level amplitude
  # LAMP b, v
  # sets lavel of output b to v in Volt
  # 0 = T0, 1 = AB, 2 = CD, 3 = EF, 4 = GH
  - property: "LAMP"
    kind: "analog"

  # level offset
  # LOFF b, v
  # sets level offset of channel b to v in Volt
  - property: "LOFF"
    kind: "analog"

  # level polarity
  # LPOL b, i
  # sets the polarity of output b to i
  # i = 1 is positive, i = 0 is negative
  - property: "LPOL"
    kind: "analog"
