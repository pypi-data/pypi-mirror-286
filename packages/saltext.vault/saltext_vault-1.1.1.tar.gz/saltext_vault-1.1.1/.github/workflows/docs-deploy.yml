# This is for testing and getting at least basic docs builds out, but could
# be integrated into the central workflow later.

# The released docs are not versioned currently, only the latest ones are deployed.
# Versioning support would require either (better):
#   * Rebuilding docs for all versions when a new release is made
#   * Version selector support in `furo`: https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo/pull/500
# or (more basic):
#   * using the `gh-pages` branch and peaceiris/actions-gh-pages
#     to be able to deploy to subdirectories. The implementation via
#     actions/deploy-pages always replaces the directory root.
