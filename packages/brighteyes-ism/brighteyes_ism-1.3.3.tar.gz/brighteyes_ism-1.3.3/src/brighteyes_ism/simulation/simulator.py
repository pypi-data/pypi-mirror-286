class ImageSimulator:
    """
    Object with methods to generate the forward model of a (multi-channel) microscope.
    The number of dimensions of phantom and the psf should differ by 1 at most.
    In this case, the last dimension of the psf is interpreted as the channel.

    Attributes
    ----------
    image : np.ndarray
        image convolved with the psf and corrupted by shot noise
    clean_image : np.ndarray
        image convolved with the psf without noise
    phantom : np.ndarray
        stucture of the specimen
    psf : np.ndarray
        point spread function. The last dimension is the channel.
    signal : float
        brightness of the sample (units: photon counts)

    Methods
    -------
    blur :
        Generates the clean image.
    poisson_noise :
        Corrupts the clean image with shot noise.
    forward :
        Generates the blurred and noisy image.
