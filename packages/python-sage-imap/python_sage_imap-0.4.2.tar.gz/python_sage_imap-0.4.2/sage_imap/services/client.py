    A context manager class for managing IMAP connections.

    Purpose
    -------

    username : str
        The username for logging into the IMAP server.
    password : str
        The password for logging into the IMAP server.

    Attributes
    ----------
    host : str
        The hostname of the IMAP server.
    username : str
        The username for logging into the IMAP server.
    password : str
        The password for logging into the IMAP server.
    connection : imaplib.IMAP4_SSL or None
        The IMAP connection object, initialized to None.

    Methods
    -------
    __enter__()
        Establishes an IMAP connection and logs in.
    __exit__(exc_type, exc_value, traceback)
        Logs out from the IMAP server and closes the connection.

    Example
    -------
    >>> with IMAPClient('imap.example.com', 'username', 'password') as client:
    ...     status, messages = client.select("INBOX")
    ...     # Process messages

        Establishes an IMAP connection and logs in.

        This method resolves the IMAP server hostname, establishes a secure IMAP
        connection,
        and logs in using the provided username and password. If any error occurs during
        these steps, appropriate custom exceptions are raised.

        Raises
        ------
        IMAPConnectionError
            If there is an issue with resolving the hostname or establishing the
            connection.
        IMAPAuthenticationError
            If login to the IMAP server fails.

        Returns
