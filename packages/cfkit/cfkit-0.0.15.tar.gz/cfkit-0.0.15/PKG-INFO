# Codeforces Contest Assistant

Welcome to the Codeforces Contest Assistant project! This tool is designed to simplify the testing process for contestants participating in Codeforces programming competitions.


## Overview

The primary objective of this program is to facilitate the testing process for contestants participating in Codeforces by providing them with seamless options to evaluate their solutions using the provided sample inputs and outputs. This includes the ability to extract the necessary input and output data from the problem statement in the form of files, or alternatively, execute their solution directly. Moreover, the program also offers file management capabilities, such as creating problem files for ongoing contests. Please note that the program is currently undergoing active development, as we continuously strive to enhance its functionality and user experience.

## Features

- Extract input and output data from problem statements.
- Execute contestant solutions with ease.
- Manage problem files for ongoing contests.
- Ongoing development and improvements.

## Getting Started
