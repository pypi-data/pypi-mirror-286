# Unit test to verify API is working correctly with a live server. Since
#  containers may not necessarily have network access, we'll use sample songs
#  from Lincity's data package...
#
# The tqdm module outputs its progress bar to stderr, so we need to add that
#  restriction.
#
# We install dependencies through the setup script rather than via the Depends
#  stanza since we have to ensure helioslicensord(1) is running before
#  heliosd(1).
