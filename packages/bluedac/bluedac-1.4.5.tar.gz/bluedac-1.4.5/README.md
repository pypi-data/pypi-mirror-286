# DAC

Bluedac is a framework made to help developers to quickly start a new cloud serverless project, specifically tied for AWS.

## In a nutshell

Its scope is to automatize as much as possible the DevOps phases of any project, briefly:
- Initialize AWS-CDK project, specifying: 
    - Programming language;
    - Branching strategy;
    - Project (deployment) environments.
- Create boilerplate unit, integration, end-to-end and load tests;
- Declare deployment strategy;
- CI/CD pipeline.
