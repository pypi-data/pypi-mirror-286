The tools are designed to be used within python and have been tested within unix environments. Installation Currently jhpce-tools is not on pypi. To install, clone the repository and run the following command from the root directory of the repository. Until it is on pypi, you will need to install it from the git repository, from which you should pull often. from jhpce.jhpce.module import * Establishing a connection One needs to have ssh paswordless access to the JHPCE cluster. For example, my username is bcaffo and I have a file ~/.ssh/id_rsa that is my private key. Given that this is set up, to establish a connections do the following: con = jhpce(\"USERNAME\", \"PATH_TO_YOUR_SSH_KEY/id_rsa\") or just con = jhpce(\"USERNAME\") if your ssh key is in the default location. For example my path would be ~/.ssh/id_rsa . Running remote commands Commands that opperate on the remote cluster are prefixed with remote_ . For example, to list the files in the current directory, one would use the following command: con.remote_ls() Lists out the files in the current remote directory. To change directories one would use the following command: con.remote_set_dir(\"RELATIVE_OR_ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_NEW_DIRECTORY\") Running local commands Commands that opperate on the local machine are prefixed with local_ . For example, to list the files in the current directory, one would use the following command: con.local_set_dirI('RELATIVE_OR_ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_NEW_DIRECTORY') Slurm commands","title":"HOME"},{"location":"#jhpce-tools","text":"This repository contains tools for working with the JHPCE cluster.
