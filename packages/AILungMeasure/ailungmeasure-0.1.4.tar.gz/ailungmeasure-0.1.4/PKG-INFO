# AILungMeasure

AILungMeasure is a Python package designed for automated lung size measurements using deep learning and computer vision on portable chest radiographs. This package aims to improve accuracy, reduce variability, and streamline the lung transplantation size matching process.

## Features

- Automated lung mask extraction from chest radiographs
- Feature points detection to generate lung height and width measurements
- Validation against measurements reported by radiologists
- Robust performance even with technically challenging radiographs

## Installation

You can install AILungMeasure via pip:

```bash
pip install AILungMeasure
```

## Usage

### Loading the Model

AILungMeasure includes a pre-trained model for lung size measurements. When importing the package, the model will be automalically downloaded and loaded. 
```python
import AILungMeasure
```

### Segmenting Lung Images

To get the lung mask, use the `get_mask` function:

```python
input_image = '/path/to/your/image' # can be dicom, jpg, png, etc.. 
mask = AILungMeasure.get_mask(input_image)
```
To visualize the mask, use the `show_mask` function:

```python
mask = AILungMeasure.show_mask(input_image)
 
# or plot it 
matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(mask)
```

### Get Measurements

To plot the lung measurements, use the `show_measurments` function:

```python
AILungMeasure.show_measurments(input_image , dpi=200) # dpi controls the image resolution
```

To get the measurments, use the `get_measurments` function:
```python
measurments = AILungMeasure.get_measurments(input_image)
```
Note that this will work if the input_image is dicom, which already includes the pixel size in its meta data. The reported measurments will be in mm.  
If you are using jpg, png, etc.. then the returned measurments will be in pixels.
