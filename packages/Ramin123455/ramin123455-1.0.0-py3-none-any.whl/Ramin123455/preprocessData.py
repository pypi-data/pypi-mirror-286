    """
    Preprocess raw gene count data through natural log transformation, normalization, and scaling. Input should be a 
    pandas data frame with cells as rows and genes as columns. Can optionally choose order of these preprocessing steps and which to be done.
    Adding 1 to the raw gene count data before hand can help prevent log(0) = undefined.
    # uses numpy and sklearn to perform natural log transformation, normalize, and scale the data
    # IMPORTANT: assay_df must be a pandas data frame where rows are cells (samples) and columns are genes (features)

        
    input:
        - assay_df: log transformed version of the RAW gene count data where cells are rows and genes are columns
        - order: value specifying 1 of 2 orders of performing preprocessing
        - log: if False, will not perform natural log transformation on data
        - normalize: if False, will not normalize the data
        - scale: if False, will not scale the data
        - add1: Possibly improve results by adding 1 to data if preprocessing in 2nd order
    output:
        - pandas data frame after raw gene count data has been preprocessed where cells are rows and genes are columns
