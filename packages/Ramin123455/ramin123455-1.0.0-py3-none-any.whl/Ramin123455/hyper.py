    """
    Predicts cell type/gene set for each unknown cell using hypergeometric testing. First acquires the gene signature for every cell n 
    by keeping the n_genes smallest euclidean distance values per cell in the distance data frame DT. Then finds W_1,W_2, ... W_omega. 
    These are the genes in each gene set W_i that are in the genes list P, the genes in the gene expression matrix after any gene filtering 
    steps (W_i is a subset of P). The gene sets W_i that have < minSize number of genes are ignored. w is acquired being the intersection of 
    the genes between each cell's gene signature and W_i. Then, hypergeometric distribution is performed with a probability mass function 
    using variables described on line 120. Probability values (p-values) between each cell and gene set is acquired. Next, optionally adjust 
    p-values with Benjamini Hochberg correction on every cell among the gene sets and/or -log base 10 transform p-values (log transform only 
    scales the values and has no affect on the prediction results). Finally, cell's gene sets are predictied using rules described on line 155.
    input: 
        - DT: pandas data frame, with genes as rows and cells as columns, of the euclidean distances between the coordinates of genes and cells
        - gene_sets: pandas series where each index is labelled with the gene set/cell type name and each value is a list of genes in that gene set/cell type 
        - n_genes: number of closest genes to keep per cell in the euclidean distance data frame, DT, to represent a cell's gene signature
        - minSize: min number of genes that a gene set must have to keep it after taking subset of P
        - p_adjust: if TRUE, apply Benjamini Hochberg correction, adjusting the p-values from hypergeo probability mass function
        - log_trans: if TRUE, apply -log base 10 to p-values after BH correction (not necessary, just upscales small p-values to larger values)
    returns a pandas Series:
        - index are the names of the unknown cells and values are the cell type/gene set predictions per cell

    PREDICTING CELL TYPE: 
    - A cell is considered as ENRICHED in those gene sets for which the hypergeometric test p-value is < 1e-02 (0.01) -> 
    only if performing benjamini hochberg correction on probability values or performing neither BH correction nor log transformation,
    OR if performing log transformation on the probability values / after BH correction, -log10 corrected p-value > 2.
    - Simplified: enrichment ranges
        - case 1: p-value < 0.01 : (neither BH correction nor log transform) or (just BH correction on p-values)
        - case 2: p-value > 2 : (only log transform the probability values) or (BH correction then log transform p-values)
    - When a disjointed classification is required (for a cell, there are multiple values/gene sets that are in the enriched range), 
        - case 1: a cell will be assigned to the gene set with the LOWEST significant corrected p-value. 
        - case 2: a cell will be assigned to the gene set with the LARGEST significant corrected p-value. 
    - If no significant hits are found (cell is not enriched in any of the gene sets), a cell will remain unassigned.
