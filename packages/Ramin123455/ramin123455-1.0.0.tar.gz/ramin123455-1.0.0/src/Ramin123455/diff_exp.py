    Returns the most differentially expressed genes per meta data grouping of the cells using scanpy's rank_genes_groups() function.
    All of the genes are given a score per cell group. Only the genes that are above the score_threshold are kept (default is 0).
    Meta data per cell is required for the rank_genes_groups() function to base a varying condition off of among the gene counts
    MUST pass log transformed version of the RAW gene count data frame in gene_count_df

    input:
        - gene_count_df: log transformed version of the RAW gene count data where cells are rows and genes are columns
        - meta_data_df: data frame containing meta data per cell (cells are rows and columns are different meta data)
        - meta_list: the list of all possible values in the meta data column used
        - meta_col_name: the column name of the meta data being used in the meta data frame
        - score_threshold: genes above this value when ranked will be kept
        - show_top_genes_plot: scanpy plot of the ranked genes per group
        - write_top_genes_to_csv: if True, will write the the genes kept to a .csv file
