# sc-pred

## Description
Python package for cell identity recognition at individual cell level from single-cell RNA-seq data.<br/><br/>
Cell types for unknown cells are predicted, through a statistical approach, using raw gene expresssion <br/>
data among a list of cells, and a gene marker dataset consisting of a list of genes found in known cell types/gene sets.<br/><br/>
sc-pred is based off of the
