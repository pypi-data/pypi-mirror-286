pygrowup-erknet
===============

modified version of: http://github.com/ewheeler/pygrowup

pygrowup calculates z-scores for the following anthropometric indicators:

* weight-for-age

* length/height-for-age

* weight-for-length/height

* head-circumference-for-age

* body-mass-index-for-age

based on the WHO Child Growth Standards:
* http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/en/
* http://www.who.int/entity/childgrowth/standards/technical_report/en/index.html

and can optionally use CDC growth standards:
* http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts

REQUIREMENTS
============

* Python 3.8 or later


INSTALLATION
============
`pip install pygrowup-erknet`


EXAMPLE USAGE
=============

Typical usage might look like this::

    from pygrowup_erknet import Calculator
    # Height adjustments are part of the WHO specification (see section 5.1)
    # to correct for recumbent vs standing measurements,
    # but none of the existing software seems to implement this.
    # default is false so values are closer to those produced
    # by igrowup software
    #
    # WHO specs include adjustments (see Chapter 7) to z-scores of weight-based
    # indicators that are greater than +/- 3 SDs. These adjustments
    # correct for right skewness and avoid making assumptions about
    # the distribution of data beyond the limits of the observed values.
    #
    # However, when calculating z-scores in a live data collection
    # situation, z-scores greater than +/- 3 SDs are likely to indicate
    # data entry or anthropometric measurement errors and should not
    # be adjusted. Instead, these large z-scores should be used to
    # identify poor data quality and/or entry errors.
    # These z-score adjustments are appropriate only when there
    # is confidence in data quality.
    #
    # In this example, Calculator is initialized with its default values
    # (i.e., ``calculator = Calculator()`` would do the same thing).
    # The ``include_cdc`` option will enable CDC measurements for children >5 years.
    # The ``override_tables`` option allows to provide a custom list of ``GrowthTable``. Can be used with ``CDC_TABLES`` to override the Who tables altogether.
    calculator = Calculator(adjust_height_data=False,
                           include_cdc=False,
                           override_tables=None)

    # The age in the calculator is always in months. To covert days to months, divide the age by 30.4375.

    calculator.zscore_for_measurement(indicator='wfa' # allowed values are: bmifa, hcfa, lfa, hfa, wfa, wfh, wfl
                                        measurement=10.4, # weight in kg, height/lengt/head circumference in cm, bmi in kg/m2
                                        sex='M, # 'M' or 'F'
                                        index_value=22.45, #age in months or length/height in cm (depends on the indicator)
                                        is_recumbent_height=False) # ignored if adjust_height_data is set to False.
    
    # The above method can be simplified using the following methods:

    calculator.lhfa(measurement=10.4, age_in_months=22.45, sex='M', is_recumbent_height=False)

    calculator.wfl(measurement=10.4, sex='M', length=84.8, is_recumbent_height=False)

    calculator.wfh(measurement=10.4, sex='M', height=84.8, is_recumbent_height=False)

    calculator.wfa(measurement=10.4, age_in_months=22.45, sex='M')

    calculator.bmifa(measurement=14.46, age_in_months=22.45, sex='M')

    calculator.hcfa(measurement=48.5, age_in_months=22.45, sex='M')
    

EXCEPTIONS
==========

caller should watch for:

as well as more specific errors (all subclasses of `RuntimeError` and `PyGrowUpError`):

* `DataNotFound` raised when no data is not found for the requested observation.

* `InvalidMeasurement` raised when measurement (height/length, bmi, weight, head circumference) is invalid for a requested indicator.

* `InvalidTableNameError` raised when an invalid indicator (table) was requested (allowed values are: bmifa, hcfa, lfa, hfa, wfa, wfh, wfl).

* `InvalidIndexError`raised when an invalid index value was given for a requested indicator (usually age or length/height).

* `InvalidAge` (subclass of `InvalidIndexError`) raised when the age is invalid for a requested indicator.

* `InvalidLengthError` (subclass of `InvalidIndexError`) raised when the length/height is invalid for a requested indicator.

* `InvalidSexError` raised when the sex could not be inferred, allowed values are 'M' or 'F'. 

TESTING
=======
to run the tests:
`$ python -m pygrowup_erknet.tests`
