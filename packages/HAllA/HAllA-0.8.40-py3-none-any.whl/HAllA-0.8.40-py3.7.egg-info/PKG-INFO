Description: Given two high-dimensional 'omics datasets X and Y (continuous and/or categorical features) from the same n biosamples, HAllA (Hierarchical All-against-All Association Testing) discovers densely-associated blocks of features in the X vs. Y association matrix where: 1) each block is defined as all associations between features in a subtree of X hierarchy and features in a subtree of Y hierarchy and 2) a block is densely associated if (1 - FNR)% of pairwise associations are FDR significant (FNR is the pre-defined expected false negative rate)
