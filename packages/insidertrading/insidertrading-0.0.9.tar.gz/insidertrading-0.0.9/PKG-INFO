## Installation

```console
pip install insidertrading
```

## License

`insidertrading` is distributed under the terms of the [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) license.

## Description

This package chooses the largest dollar transactions in the SEC form345
file and reports transactions where the stock price rose, in case of an
acquisition, or fell, in case of a disposal, over a certain percentage
during the following week.

THIS DOES NOT CLAIM THAT ANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE ILLEGAL.

It merely reports that the stock moved by some threshold after the
transaction. It could be because of personal reasons, coincidence,
because the stock is unusually volatile, or some other innocuous reason.

If you do not provide a --yq argument, the command determines the last
quarter from the current date and uses that

if you do not provide an --insiderdb argument, the sqlite3 database is
created in RAM.

## Usage

usage: edgarinsidertrading [-h] [--yq YQ] [--threshold THRESHOLD]
                           [--interval INTERVAL] [--insiderdb INSIDERDB]
                           [--directory DIRECTORY] [--file FILE]
