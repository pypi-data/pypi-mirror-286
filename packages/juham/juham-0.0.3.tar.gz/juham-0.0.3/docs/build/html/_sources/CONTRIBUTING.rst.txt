Contributing to Juham - Juha's Ultimate Home Automation Masterpiece
===================================================================

Thank You!
----------

Thank you in advance for your forthcoming contributions, whether they are bug fixes, documentation improvements, 
entirely new features, or simply feedback. Your efforts will 
be highly appreciated and will help turn this project from its current mission state into an actual masterpiece.

Design Patterns
---------------

Please read the developer documentation (okay, the documentation is currently lacking many essential chapters) and understand the few design patterns 
behind Juham before contributing. This will help ensure that your contributions align with the project's design and goals.


Code Formatting
---------------

To help maintain consistent code formatting across different developers, we use 'black' python formatter, by Microsoft.
(Okay, the formatter doesn't seem to format much, it doesn't organize imports, doesn't remove extra lines between imports, 
doesn't format docstring lenghts, most likely I don't know how to use it properly).


Using Emacs and Makefile
------------------------

Despite my attempts to fall in love with Eclipse, VSCode and other IDEs, I still find Emacs and Makefile more efficient for my workflow. 
So there is a Makefile in the root folder. For those old dogs who are like me
::
    
    make help
