# LiteStash

A quick key-value store for Python, built on SQLite with a NoSQL style API.

## Overview

The LiteStash Python project offers a lightning-fast, lightweight key-value storage for Python applications.  LiteStash provides a NoSQL API for seamless integration into your applications.  Optimal use for caching, session management, and other high-performance use cases.  LiteStash is for high-performance storage of key-value data that leverages SQLite's reliability and speed, optimized for scenarios where you need quick access to data.

## Key-Value Store

LiteStash is easy to integrate into your Python applications, especially web frameworks like FastAPI and Django.  Keys are hashed and indexed by Sqlite in the background.

## Features

* **Performance:** Utilizes functional paradigm for near-instantaneous access.
* **Pydantic Data Validation:** Ensures type safety and data integrity using Pydantic models.
* **Distributed Hash Table:** Organizes data across multiple SQLite databases
* **API:**  Offers a simple and intuitive API for interacting with the key-value store. 
* **Lightweight and Easy to Use:**  Minimal dependencies and straightforward setup.
* **Flexible Data Types:**  Supports string keys and various value types, including strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries (serialized as JSON).

## Use Cases

* **Caching:** Store frequently accessed data, such as API responses, database query results, or computed values.
* **Session Management:**  Manage user sessions in web applications.
* **Temporary Data Storage:** Store transient data for short-lived tasks or calculations.


## Project
Thanks for checking out the beta release of LiteStash.  More features are in the works.  The Github is a mirror of the project at this time.  LiteStash is under active development and working towards the first release.
