[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/reqver.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/reqver)

**Latest version: 0.1.8**

A command-line tool to add version information to requirements.txt files.

## Installation

```
pip install reqver
```

## Usage

```
reqver [OPTIONS] [FILES]...
```

If no files are given, reqver looks for requirements.txt in the current directory. If not found, it searches parent directories. If still not found, it displays an error message.

### Options:

- `--force`: Force update of all package versions, even if they already have version information.
- `--no-backups`: Do not create backup files when updating requirements files.

### Examples:

1. Process requirements.txt in the current directory:
   ```
   reqver
   ```

2. Process a specific requirements file:
   ```
   reqver path/to/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Process multiple requirements files:
   ```
   reqver req1.txt req2.txt
   ```

4. Force update all versions:
   ```
   reqver --force requirements.txt
   ```

5. Update without creating backups:
   ```
   reqver --no-backups requirements.txt
   ```

## Behavior

For each specified file (or the found requirements.txt):

1. Treats it as a requirements file (if it is a text file).
2. For each requirement in the file:
   - If version info is present: leaves it as is, unless the `--force` option is set.
   - If no version info is present: gets the current version with pip.
3. Creates a backup of the old requirements file (unless `--no-backups` is used).
4. Writes the new requirements file with updated version information.
