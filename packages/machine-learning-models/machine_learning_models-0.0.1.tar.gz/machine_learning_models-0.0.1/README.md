# About this repo
This repository contains my own implementations of the most popular machine learning models. It also has scripts for data preproccessing (datasets titanic and GaltonFamilies). For classification, I implemented my own class for nested cross validation. There are functions to evaluate model using confusion matrix (calculating accurancy, sensitivity, specificity, precision etc.) as well as to draw ROC curve.

# Note
All of the models and validation were implemented by myslef, without using sklearn library. They were done for learning purposes. There is a seperate file named sklearn.py, in which I focused on exploring sklearn library
