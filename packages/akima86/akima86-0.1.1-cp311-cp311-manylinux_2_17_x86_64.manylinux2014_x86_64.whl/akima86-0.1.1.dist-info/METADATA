    # Typical users do not have to make any modifications to the commands
    # within this README, and can copy and paste directly.

    # REPO_URL should point to the base URL for git clone commands
    export REPO_URL=https://github.com/NRLMMD-GeoIPS

    # BASEDIR will contain all source, output, and external dependencies
    # Ensure this is consistently set for all installation / setup steps below
    export BASEDIR=$HOME/geoproc

```
