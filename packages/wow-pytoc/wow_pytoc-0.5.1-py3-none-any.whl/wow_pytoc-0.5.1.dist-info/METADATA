# pytoc

A Python package for parsing World of Warcraft TOC files used in addons.

## Installation

You can install this package via `pip`.

```py
pip install wow-pytoc
```

## Usage

Reading a TOC file:
```py
from pytoc import TOCFile, Dependency

file_path: str = "X:/path/to/my/addon.toc"
toc = TOCFile(file_path)

print(toc.Interface)
print(toc.Title)
print(toc.LocalizedTitles["frFR"])
print(toc.AdditionalFields["X-Website"])

for file in toc.Files:
    print(file)

for dep in toc.Dependencies
    dep: Dependency
    print(f"Dependency Name: {dep.Name} Required: {dep.Required}")
```

Writing a TOC file:
```py
from pytoc import TOCFile

toc = TOCFile()
toc.Interface = 110000
toc.Author = "Ghost"
toc.Files = ["file1.lua", "file2.xml"]

required = True
toc.add_dependency("totalRP3", required)

output = "path/to/dest.toc"
toc.export(output)
```

For some examples, take a look at the [test_toc.py](tests/test_toc.py) file.

## Notes

All dependency fields will be added to the `TOCFile.Dependencies` list. Fields that are not available to addons, or extra fields that don't begin with "X-" will be added directly to the object namespace.

Fields will overwrite eachother if more than one of that directive is present in the TOC file.

For certain fields that accept comma-delimited input, the attribute may end up being either a `list` or a `str|int`, depending on if there are multiple entries or just a single one.
