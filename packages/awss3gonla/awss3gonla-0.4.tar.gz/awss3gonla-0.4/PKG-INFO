# `awss3gonla` Library

## Overview

The `awss3gonla` class provides a Python interface for interacting with AWS S3 storage. It allows for operations such as uploading and downloading files, managing parquet files, and handling data partitions. This class is designed to work with the AWS SDK for Python (`boto3`) and the Polars library for data manipulation.

## Features

- **Configuration**: Easily configure AWS credentials and region.
- **Upload Files**: Upload files to an S3 bucket, including text, JSON, and parquet files.
- **Download Files**: Download files from an S3 bucket into a buffer.
- **List Objects**: List objects in a specific S3 path.
- **Manage Partitions**: Handle parquet file partitions and read them into Polars DataFrames.

## Installation

To use the `awss3gonla` class, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `boto3`
- `polars`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install boto3 polars
```

## Usage

### Initialization

Create an instance of the `awss3gonla` class with your AWS credentials and bucket name:

```python
import awss3gonla

s3 = awss3gonla.client(
    aws_access_key_id='your_access_key',
    aws_secret_access_key='your_secret_key',
    region_name='your_region',
    bucket_name='your_bucket_name'
)
```

## Methods
get(path: str, name: str)

Placeholder method for future implementation to retrieve an object from S3. Currently not implemented.

```python
# Example usage (not implemented):
s3.get('path/to/object', 'object_name')
```

list(path: str)
Lists objects in the specified S3 path.
```python
objects = s3.list('some/path/')
print(objects)
```

put(path: str, name: str)
Uploads a file from the local path to S3.

```python
s3.put('local/path/to/file', 'destination/name')
```

put_object(path: str, name: str, _object: str | Dict[str, Any])

Uploads an object (string or dictionary) to S3. Automatically detects the content type based on the input type.

```python
s3.put_object('some/path', 'object_name', 'some string content')
s3.put_object('some/path', 'object_name', {'key': 'value'})
```
put_parquet(dataframe: pl.DataFrame, path: str, name: Optional[str] = None, partition_cols: Optional[dict] = None) -> str
Uploads a Polars DataFrame to S3 as a parquet file. Supports partitioning based on specified columns.

```python
import polars as pl

df = pl.DataFrame({
    'col1': [1, 2, 3],
    'col2': ['a', 'b', 'c']
})

key = s3.put_parquet(df, 'some/path/', name='optional_name', partition_cols={'col1': 'value'})
print(f"Parquet file uploaded to S3 with key: {key}")
```

list_parquet(path: str)
Lists parquet files in the specified S3 path.

```python
parquet_files = s3.list_parquet('some/path/')
print(parquet_files)
```

get_objects(path: str, buffer: Any)
Downloads an object from S3 into a provided buffer.

```python
import io

buffer = io.BytesIO()
s3.get_objects('some/path/to/object', buffer)
print(buffer.getvalue())
```
get_parquet_partition(path: str) -> pl.DataFrame
Retrieves all parquet files from a specified path and combines them into a single Polars DataFrame.

```python
df = s3.get_parquet_partition('some/path/')
print(df)
```

## Error Handling

### The put_object method handles common exceptions, including:

* FileNotFoundError
* UnboundLocalError
* TypeError
* AttributeError


## Notes
Ensure that AWS credentials are properly configured.
The get method is a placeholder and not yet implemented.
