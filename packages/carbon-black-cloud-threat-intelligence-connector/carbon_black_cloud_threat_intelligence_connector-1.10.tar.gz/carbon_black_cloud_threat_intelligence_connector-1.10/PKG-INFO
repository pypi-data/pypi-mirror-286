## Developing the connector

We rely on pull requests to keep this project maintained. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the VMware [code of conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

### Setup

It is recommended to use Python3.8 / Python3.9 version for that project, assuming that you installed the deps with either virtualenv or poetry.

For a good code quality make sure to install the hooks from `pre-commit` as well.

```shell-session
$ pre-commit install
```

### Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/carbonblack/carbon-black-cloud-threat-intelligence-connector.git
$ cd carbon-black-cloud-threat-intelligence-connector/
```

You can install this connector either via Poetry or using the `virtualenv`.

#### Using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

You will need to [install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) first.

To install the connector run:

```shell-session
$ poetry install
```

#### Using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

You will need to [install virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) first.

```bash
$ virtualenv venv
...
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Tests

The tests can be run with the following command:

```shell-session
$ pytest ./tests/unit/
```
For running the performance tests check out the [README](tests/performance/README.md)

### Support
