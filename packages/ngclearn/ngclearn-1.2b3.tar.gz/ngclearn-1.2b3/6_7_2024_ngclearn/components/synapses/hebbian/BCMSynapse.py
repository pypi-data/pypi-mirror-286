    """
    A synaptic cable that adjusts its efficacies in accordance with BCM
    (Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro) theory.

    | --- Synapse Compartments: ---
    | inputs - input (takes in external signals)
    | outputs - output signal (transformation induced by synapses)
    | weights - current value matrix of synaptic efficacies
    | key - JAX RNG key
    | --- Synaptic Plasticity Compartments: ---
    | pre - pre-synaptic spike to drive 1st term of BCM update (takes in external signals)
    | post - post-synaptic spike to drive 2nd term of BCM update (takes in external signals)
    | theta - synaptic threshold (post-synaptic) variables
    | dWeights - current delta matrix containing changes to be applied to synapses

    Args:
        name: the string name of this cell

        shape: tuple specifying shape of this synaptic cable (usually a 2-tuple

        w_decay: synaptic decay factor (default: 0.)

        weight_init: a kernel to drive initialization of this synaptic cable's values;
            typically a tuple with 1st element as a string calling the name of
            initialization to use

        resist_scale: a fixed scaling factor to apply to synaptic transform
            (Default: 1.), i.e., yields: out = ((W * Rscale) * in)

        p_conn: probability of a connection existing (default: 1.); setting
            this to < 1. will result in a sparser synaptic structure
