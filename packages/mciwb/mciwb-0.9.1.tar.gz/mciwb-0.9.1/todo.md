Ideas to Add
============

mcwb
----

mciwb
-----

-   add Volume (and Blocks?) to the Copier class and expose to Iwb
-   tutorial on creating signs
-   add a consistent way to discover and delete signs, switches, monitors
-   add ability to switch on/off deug logging from ipython
-   make logger only debug mciwb - other loggers are too noisy

village
-------
 
-   towers and walls
-   a drawbridge / portcullis that open and close
-   a rotating object using blocks (with a face on)
-   or even better a patrolling tower / robot ? 

Finale
------

Have a button that destroys the village and flattens the land

and a button that re-creates everything from scratch.
