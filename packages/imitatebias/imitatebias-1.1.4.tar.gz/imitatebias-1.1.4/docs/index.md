# Welcome to imitatebias!

This package offers methods for selection bias identification and mitigation under the assumption that no ground truth is available or known.

Machine Learning typically assumes that training and test set are independently drawn from the same distribution, but this assumption is often violated in practice which creates a bias. Many attempts to identify and mitigate this bias have been proposed, but they usually rely on ground-truth information. But what if the researcher is not even aware of the bias?

In contrast to prior work, we introduce new methods, IMITATE, MIMIC, and CANCELS, to identify and mitigate Selection Bias in the case that we may not know if (and where) a bias is present, and hence no ground-truth information is available.

Those methods investigate the dataset's probability density, then add generated points or points selected from a pool in order to smooth out the density. While IMITATE models the data as a bias-aware multivariate Gaussian, the most common density occurring in real-world applications, MIMIC aims for a bias-aware Gaussian Mixture Model. If the artificial points focus on certain areas and are not widespread, this could indicate a Selection Bias where these areas are underrepresented in the sample.

CANCELS is a unique version of IMITATE specifically designed to work in the Chemical Compound Space. It uses Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of typically sparsely distributed or binary feature representations of chemical compounds, and applies IMITATE in PCA-space. Rather than generating points to mitigate the identified selection bias, CANCELS selects from a pool of candidate compounds ensuring that they are feasible compounds.

## Installation
