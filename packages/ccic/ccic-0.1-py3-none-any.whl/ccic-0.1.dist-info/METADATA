# The Chalmers Cloud Ice Climatology

This repository contains all source code for the training and processing of the
retrieval underlying the Chalmers Cloud Ice Climatology (CCIC) data record.

## Documentation

Documentation describing the CCIC data, its uses, and how to run the retrievals can be found [here](https://ccic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html).

## Data

At the time of writing, the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws) contains all CCIC total ice water path estimates until 2023. The data can be found [here](https://registry.opendata.aws/ccic/).

## References

The CCIC retrieval, its implementation, and validation results are presented in Amell, A., Pfreundschuh, S., and Eriksson, P.: The Chalmers Cloud Ice Climatology: Retrieval implementation and validation, EGUsphere [preprint], [https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1953](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1953), 2023.
