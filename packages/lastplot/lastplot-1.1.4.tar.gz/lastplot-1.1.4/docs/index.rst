What is it
-----------

Lipid Analysis and Statistical Testing with Plotting for LC-MS Output Transformation (LastPlot) is a Python package designed to elaborate data into graphs coming from lipid extractions (LC/MS). Starting from a file containing the pmol/mg values per each sample, this package streamlines the process of data analysis and visualization.

Features
--------

LastPlot includes the following features:

- **Data Sanitization:** Clean and prepare data for analysis, removing internal standard samples and non-value samples.
- **Data Normalization:** Normalize values with log10 to ensure consistency across samples.
- **Normality Check:** Use the Shapiro-Wilk test to check for normality of residuals.
- **Equality of Variance Check:** Use Levene's test to assess the equality of variances.
- **Statistical Significance Annotation:** Annotate boxplots with significance levels using t-test, Welch's t-test, Mann-Whitney, or two-way ANOVA test depending on the data requirements, through the starbars package.
- **Visualization Tools:** Create boxplots to aid in data interpretation.

Installation
------------

You can install the package via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install lastplot

Alternatively, you can install the package from the source:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/elide-b/lastplot.git
    cd lastplot
    pip install .

Usage
-----

Here is one example of how to use LastPlot:

.. code-block:: python

    import lastplot

    # Example usage
    df = lastplot.data_workflow(
    file_path="My project.xlsx",
    data_sheet="Data Sheet",
    mice_sheet="Mice ID Sheet",
    output_path="C:/Users/[YOUR-USERNAME]/Documents/example",
    control_name="WT",
    experimental_name=["FTD", "BPD", "HFD"]
    )

    lastplot.zscore_graph_region(
        df_final=df,
        control_name="CM",
        experimental_name=["FTD", "BPD", "HFD"],
        output_path="C:/Users/[YOUR-USERNAME]/Documents/example",
        palette="Set2",
        show=True,
    )

Returns graphs.
