Summary: Beaverish about data. Metabeaver originally started as a "glue" project to bring together commonly used code. It has since expanded to contain common operations, metaprogramming, and Computer Sci resources. It is intended a resource to learn computer science, Python, and limit the need to rebuild the wheel. For development operations, please see Operation Beaver.
