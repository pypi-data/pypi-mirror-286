# :deciduous_tree: Treehouse Planner :evergreen_tree:

The Treehouse Planner is designed to assist you in the initial planning phase of building an amazing treehouse. Whether you're evaluating trees for suitability, assessing tree safety, or drafting accurate scaled layouts for platforms, beams, walls, and posts, this tool aims to streamline your treehouse construction process.

## Features

- **Tree Evaluation:** Assess the suitability of trees based on various criteria.
- **Tree Safety:** Evaluate tree safety factors to ensure stability and reliability.
- **Scaled Layout Planning:** Generate accurately scaled plans for treehouse platforms, beams, walls, and posts.
- **Visualization:** Visualize example tree platform layouts to inspire your designs.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Treehouse Planner:

### Installation

1. **Package Installation**

You can install Treehousing Planner tool via pip from PyPI:


    pip install treehouse-planner


2. **Install Dependencies:**

Ensure you have Python 3.x and `pip` installed.

## Usage

1. **Run the program:**

Navigate to the `src/treehouse_design/` directory and run the `treehouse_layout.py` script:

    
    cd src/treehouse_design/
    python treehouse_layout.py


2. **Follow Program Instructions:**

The program will guide you through the steps for evaluating trees, assessing safety, and generating scaled layouts.
