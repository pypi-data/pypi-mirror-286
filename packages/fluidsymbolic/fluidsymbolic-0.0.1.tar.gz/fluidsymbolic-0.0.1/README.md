UNFINISHED PROJECT

## Documentation

The documentation is available in html [here](https://alexandredela.github.io) (generated by Sphinx).
This module is a module designed to help deal with object-oriented logging.

## Goal
Plot some fluid mechanics equation using symbolic mathematics using sympy,
scipy integrate, matplotlib and matplotlib animations.

## Rationale

While reading Tony S. Yu's article on animated stream functions and vorticity, 
I noticed many scripts were severely outdated.
Therefore I had this project to remake everything 
in a more modern fashion.


How to use?
-----------

Examples are available inside the **example** folder.

How does it work?
-----------------

In construction.

Limitations
-----------

This module only assumes 2D flows, the speed on the vertical axis 
is supposed to be negligible.
