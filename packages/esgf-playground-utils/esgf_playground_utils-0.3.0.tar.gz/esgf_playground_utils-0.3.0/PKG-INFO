## How to contribute?

This is simple library and is expected to undergo many changes as it matures towards the expected outcome of a suite
for the new ESGF publication system.

To contribute, you should be using `poetry` as your python package manager, see https://python-poetry.org for
installation instructions.

To install all package and development dependencies:

```shell
foo@bar:~$ poetry install 
```

To activate the `pre-commit hooks` run:

```shell
foo@bar:~$ poetry run install pre-commit
