## Installation & usage

This work is released on PyPi. Installation, therefore, is as simple as installing the package with pip:

```bash
python3 -m pip install adaptive-neighbourhoods
```

At this point, you're free to start generating neighbourhoods for your own dataset:

```python
from adaptive_neighbourhoods import epsilon_expand

neighbourhoods = epsilon_expand(
    x,  # your input data
    y)  # the integer encoded labels for your data
```

Move information on the variable parameters and general guidance on using this package can be found at: https://adaptive-neighbourhoods.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
