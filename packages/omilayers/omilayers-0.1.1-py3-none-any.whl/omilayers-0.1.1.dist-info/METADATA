# omilayers

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pip/badge/?version=stable)](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/?badge=stable) 

``omilayers`` is a Python data management library. It is suitable for multi-omic data analysis, hence the `omi` prefix, that involves the handling of diverse datasets usually referred to as omic layers. `omilayers` is based on `DuckDB` and provides a high-level interface for frequent and repetitive tasks that involve fast storage, processing and retrieval of data without the need to constantly write SQL queries.

The rationale behind `omilayer` is the following:

* User stores **layers** of omic data (tables in SQL lingo).
* User creates new layers by processing and restructuring existing layers.
* User can group layers using **tags**.
* User can store a brief description for each layer.


## Why omilayers?

Using the Python API provided by `DuckDB`, the user would need to write the following code to parse a column named `foo` from a layer called `omicdata`:

```python
import duckdb

with duckdb.connect("dbname.duckdb") as con:
   result = con.sql("SELECT foo FROM omicdata").fetchdf()
```

Although the above SQL query is straightfoward, it can become quite tedious task if it needs to be repeated multiple times. Since data analysis involves highly repetitive procedures, a user would need to create functions as a means to abstract the process of writing SQL queries. The aim of `omilayers` is to provide this level of abstaction to facilitate bioinformatic data analysis. The `omilayers` API resembles the `pandas` API and the user needs to write the following code to perform the above task:

```python
from omilayers import Omilayers

omi = Omilayers("dbname.duckdb")
result = omi.layers['omicdata']['foo']
```


## Testing with synthetic omic data

The directory `synthetic_data` includes a jupyter notebook for testing `omilayers` using synthetic multi-omic data.


## Installation

```
pip install omilayers
```
