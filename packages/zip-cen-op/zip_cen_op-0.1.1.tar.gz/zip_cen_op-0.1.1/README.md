# ZIP-CEN-OP

ZIP-CEN-OP is a command-line tool for manipulating the encryption flags in ZIP file central directories. It allows you to add or remove encryption flags without actually encrypting or decrypting the contents, which can be useful for testing or working with systems that expect certain ZIP file characteristics.

## Features

- Add encryption flags to ZIP files (fake encryption)
- Remove encryption flags from ZIP files (fake decryption)
- Easy-to-use command-line interface

## Installation

You can install ZIP-CEN-OP using pip:

```
pip install zip-cen-op
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the `zipcenop` command directly from your terminal:

```
zipcenop <option> <file>
```

Where:
- `<option>` is either `r` (recover/remove encryption flag) or `e` (encrypt/add encryption flag)
- `<file>` is the path to the ZIP file you want to manipulate

### Examples

To add an encryption flag to a ZIP file:

```
zipcenop e path/to/your/file.zip
```

To remove an encryption flag from a ZIP file:

```
zipcenop r path/to/your/file.zip
```

## Warning

This tool only manipulates the encryption flag in the ZIP file's central directory. It does not actually encrypt or decrypt the contents of the ZIP file. Use this tool responsibly and be aware of potential security implications.
