    This Action supports using the BASE_URL environment variable to
    set a base URL. If you set BASE_URL, the url passed in to this
    Action will be appended to the end of it. For example, if you
    have ``BASE_URL=http://localhost``, then ``Open("/home")`` will send
    your browser to "http://localhost/home".

    If you pass in an object, make sure the object has a ``url`` property
    that can be referenced by this Action.
