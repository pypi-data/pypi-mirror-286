## About

Swiftshadow is a powerful Python library designed to simplify the process of rotating IP proxies for web scraping, data mining, and other automated tasks. With its advanced features, Swiftshadow can help you overcome many of the challenges associated with web scraping, including blocked IP addresses and other forms of detection.

One of the key benefits of Swiftshadow is its speed. The library is designed to operate quickly and efficiently, which means you can scrape data at a faster rate than with other tools. Additionally, Swiftshadow includes a built-in caching mechanism that helps to reduce the load time and improve performance.

Another important feature of Swiftshadow is its reliability. The library is designed to be robust and resilient, which means that even if one of your proxies fails or is blocked, the system will automatically switch to another proxy to ensure continuity of your scraping process. This feature helps to ensure that your scraping efforts are not interrupted by technical issues or other problems.

Swiftshadow is also highly customizable. You can easily configure the library to suit your specific needs, including specifying the number of proxies to use, the frequency of rotation, and other parameters. This level of flexibility makes Swiftshadow a versatile tool that can be adapted to a wide range of use cases.

Finally, Swiftshadow has a low dependency on third-party libraries (only one), which makes it easier to use and maintain. Whether you are a seasoned developer or a novice, you can quickly get started with Swiftshadow and start scraping data with ease.

## Installation

To get started install the library using pip.
