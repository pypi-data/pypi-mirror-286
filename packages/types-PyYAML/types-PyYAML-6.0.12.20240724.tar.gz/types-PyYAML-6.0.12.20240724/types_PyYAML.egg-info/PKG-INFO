## Typing stubs for PyYAML

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`PyYAML`](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`PyYAML`.

This version of `types-PyYAML` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `PyYAML==6.0.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/PyYAML. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`0b1d35829b3f727ce562987360eabf45873d413c`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/0b1d35829b3f727ce562987360eabf45873d413c) and was tested
with mypy 1.10.1, pyright 1.1.372, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
