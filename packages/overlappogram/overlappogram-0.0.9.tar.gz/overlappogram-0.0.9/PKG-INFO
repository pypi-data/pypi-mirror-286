Overlappogram is a Python package for inverting overlappogram observations of the Sun,
for examples MaGIXS, CubIXSS, or ECCCO observations.

For background on the theory of this technique, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10436v1).


## Install

`pip install overlappogram` or clone the repository and install manually.

## How to Use

`overlappogram` comes with an executable main that you can run:

`unfold ./path/to/config.toml`

The `config.toml` file should be structured similar to the [example_config.toml](example_config.toml).
We provide more description of the config file [in the documentation](https://eccco-mission.github.io/overlappogram/configuration.html).
