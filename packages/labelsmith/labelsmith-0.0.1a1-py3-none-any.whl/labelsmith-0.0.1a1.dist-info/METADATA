## ⚠️ Alpha Release Notice

**Important:** Labelsmith is currently in its early alpha stage (v0.0.1a1). It is not yet ready for production use. Features may be incomplete, and significant changes may occur between versions. Use at your own risk.

## Project Description

**Labelsmith** is an open-source Python project designed to streamline data annotators' workflows. Our goal is to create a robust, extensible toolkit that empowers the data science and machine learning community.

### Current Features

The `labelsmith` package currently offers the following core modules:

1. **`shyft`**: A comprehensive shift-logging application built on the `tkinter` GUI framework. Key features include:
   
   - Automatic shift duration tracking with a configurable, always-on-top timer
   - Task metadata recording and note-taking interface
   - Local data persistence for shift entries and tasking history
   - Full CRUD operations for shift records

2. **`utils`**: A collection of utility scripts aimed at optimizing annotator workflows:
   - `utils.income`: Includes the `simulate` function for modeling earnings scenarios based on various workload parameters

## Installation

```bash
pip install labelsmith
```

Please note that this is an alpha release and may not be stable. It is recommended to install in a virtual environment for testing purposes.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels! Check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how to get started.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement `utils.metrics` module
- [ ] Add unit tests and increase code coverage
