Neuroimaging transformations in XLA

This repository is intended to be a tensor-level implementation of common neuroimaging transformations that can be compiled to XLA. Its existence has become necessary as a consequence of shared dependencies among ``hypercoil`` (differentiable programming for brain mapping) and ``entense`` (compositional data-to-tensor workflow assembler). Code here underpins both libraries.
