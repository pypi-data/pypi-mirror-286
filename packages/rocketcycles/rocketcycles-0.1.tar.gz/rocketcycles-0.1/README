Hi,

Welcome to RocketCycles. It is a python library dedicated to staged combustion rocket engine cycles. It
allows to both analyse and size them in order to get combustion chamber performance, pressure ratio of the turbines or
pressure rise in the pumps, crossflow massflows etc.

elements.py stores functions representing pumps, turbines, preburners, combustion chambers. They can be
assembled together into a staged combustion rocket engine cycle.

fluid.py stores RocketCycleFluid class that conveniently allows to store data about propellants or
preburner products, as well as to get their thermophysical properties using NASA 9 polynomials or real gas density
using PyFluids (wrapper about CoolProp).

cycles.py stores definitions of classes representing different staged combustion rocket engine cycles.
These can be used as inspiration if you want to assemble your own closed cycle.

examples.py shows how to call these classes and perform the analysis.

tests.py stores unit tests for the package.

It is highly recommened that you see the code, so that you know what is happening under the hood and are aware of any
assumptions.

I hope you will find the library useful!

Cheers,
Jan
