# Apple Searchads API Library in Python

In order to facilitate the usage of the Apple Search Ads API Phiture's Engineers 
have built a library in Python which allows users to manage campaigns, ad groups, 
keywords and creative sets. This library only requires intermediate Python skills 
and therefore makes it possible not only for Engineers but also for Data Analysts 
and Apple Search Ads Consultants to work with it.  
While the library is extensive it is not complete and users are encouraged to commit suggestions.

Read the docs on github.

# Example Usage:

Setup for v4 of the library

create a certs directory inside of your project folder, or create a different certs directory and specify it using the certificates_dir_path argument.

         api = SearchAdsAPI(2134535, "public.pem","private.key", 
         client_id="SEARCHADS.07875add-f6cd-4111-9c38-b84501d557c8",
         team_id="SEARCHADS.07879add-d6cd-4111-9c38-b84501d527c8",
         key_id="78a167b1-e423-4ab4-bcd1-8be75a4d7b7e", verbose=True)

### Campaign Methods
