From the ERO JWST observations of SMACS J0723.3-7327 with NIRSpec. Based on two galaxies at z=7.7 and one at z=8.5.
NOTE: The authors provide 3 determinations of O/H. We use as fiducial value the "direct" method when available and the "strong line" 
when not. The upper/lower error encloses the range of values obtained with the three methods.
