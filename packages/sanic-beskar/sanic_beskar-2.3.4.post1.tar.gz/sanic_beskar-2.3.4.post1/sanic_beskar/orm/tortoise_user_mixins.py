    A short-cut providing required methods and attributes for a user class
    implemented with `tortoise-orm <https://tortoise.github.io/>`_. Makes
    many assumptions about how the class is defined.

    ASSUMPTIONS:

    * The model has an ``id`` column that uniquely identifies each instance
    * The model has a ``roles`` column that contains the roles for the
      user instance as a comma separated list of roles
    * The model has a ``username`` column that is a unique string for each instance
    * The model has a ``password`` column that contains its hashed password
