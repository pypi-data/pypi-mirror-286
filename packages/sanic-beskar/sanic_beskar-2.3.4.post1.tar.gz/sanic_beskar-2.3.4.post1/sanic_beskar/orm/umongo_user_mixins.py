    * The model has an ``id`` column that uniquely identifies each instance
    * The model has a ``rolenames`` column that contains the roles for the
      user instance as a comma separated list of roles
    * The model has a ``username`` column that is a unique string for each instance
    * The model has a ``password`` column that contains its hashed password

        This can be a separate table (probably sane), so long as this attribute
        or property properly returns the associated values for the user as a
