# Changelog

## v1.1.0 | 2023-05-30

We got another update of your favourite quantum-package.
Without a doubt, the biggest change in the software is that KITE is now
also available through a pip-installation. This should make it possible to install it
on any machine. However, if you want to use some advanced features you still have to manually
install the KITEx program using CMake or the compilation script.
