**BioComet** is an advanced bioinformatics tool designed to facilitate the analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPIs)
and the exploration of biological networks. Built as an object-oriented Python module, BioComet leverages the **STRING** database
to provide users with powerful capabilities for community detection, functional annotation, and network visualization.

### 📚 Principle
Large gene lists or gene lists emerging from the analysis of complex conditions can functionally point to a variety of underlying biological pathways. 
When analyzing all of these data as one input in a functional enrichment analysis, this can lead to a facilitation of the unspecific top-level terms obscuring more detailed underlying findings.
E.g., this set of 139 genes emerging as commonly appearing in several neurodegenerative diseases 
([Ruffini et al., Cells 2020](https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9122642)) shows a functional enrichment that is most significantly associated with the vague top-level term "Disease".

If assuming that the transcriptomic commonalities between these neurodegenerative diseases is derived from a variety of processes, a further observation of this large gene set as subnetworks might shed more light into the fine underlying pathways.

## 🪧 Features
- **🔍 Community Detection**: Utilize the Louvain and Leiden algorithms for robust community detection in PPI networks.
- **📖 Functional Annotation**: Perform comprehensive functional annotation using databases like KEGG, Reactome, MetaCyc, the EBI Complex Portal, and Gene Ontology Complexes.
- **🎨 Network Visualization**: Generate visual representations of PPI networks, including specific communities, with support for various visualization methods.
- **🌐 Integrated Hub Node Detection**: Seamlessly identify hub nodes within communities or across the entire PPI graph.

## 🛠 Installation
**BioComet** is distributed via PyPi, so it can easily be installed with `pip`. 
However, in case problems might arise, we also shortly showcase how to install it in a fresh conda environment.

### 📦 Using pip
**BioComet** can be easily installed via pip:

```bash
pip install biocomet
```

### 🐍 Using conda

If any issues arise, trying creating a new conda environment with Pyton >=3.6 and installing biocomet in that fresh environment.
This could e.g. look like this:

```bash
conde create -n biocomet_env python=3.10
conda activate biocomet_env
pip install biocomet
```

## 🚀 Usage

After installation, you can start using **BioComet** by importing it into your Python projects:

```python
import pandas as pd
import biocomet as bc

# either draw data from our example section or use your own data

# loading your data could e.g. look like this
my_DEG_results = pd.read('path/to/my/DEG_results.csv')


# Example usage
ppi_graph = bc.PPIGraph(gene_list=my_DEG_results['GeneID'], reg_list=my_DEG_results['logFC'])
```
For more details see the example section in which we offer three different use-cases to browse through.
