Marcelene Boyer sold the most compared to other sales staff for several reasons. Here are some key factors that contributed to her high sales performance:

1. Higher average discount: Marcelene offered a slightly higher average discount (10.8%) on her sales compared to other sales staff. This could have attracted more customers and encouraged them to make purchases.

2. Product selection: The products Marcelene sold had a higher average sales amount compared to other staff members. This means that the items she sold were generally more expensive, which could have contributed to her higher total sales amount.

3. Quantity sold: Marcelene sold an average of 1.5 items per sale, which is slightly higher than some of her colleagues. This indicates that she was able to sell more items per transaction, leading to a higher overall sales amount.

4. Customer base: Marcelene's customers had a higher average sales amount compared to other staff members' customers. This suggests that she was able to attract customers who were willing to spend more on their purchases.

In summary, Marcelene Boyer's high sales performance can be attributed to her ability to offer higher discounts, sell more expensive products, sell more items per transaction, and attract customers who were willing to spend more on their purchases.
