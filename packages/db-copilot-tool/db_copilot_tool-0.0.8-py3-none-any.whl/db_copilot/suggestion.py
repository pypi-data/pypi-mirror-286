Task:
Given the database schema, generate some useful data analysis queries.

Here are some rules that the output should follow:
- In the <Suggestion>...</Suggestion> block, there should be {num} diverse data analysis queries.
- Each line has only one suggested query.
- Each line should start with a English letter.
- Only need text query and do not contain any SQL in the suggestions.
- It's better to generate questions related with the last previous query.
- These {num} data analysis queries should have different prefixes, i.e., the first word of each suggestions are different.
- It's better that one of these query suggests chart, for example, as a bar chart.
{mode_templates[creative]["query_constraints"]}

Please remember very important things below:
- Don't generate duplicate suggestions.
- Don't generate any suggestion which is included in previous queries.
- Don't generate the same pattern suggestions.
- Don't add "." at the end of each line.
- Don't use some subjective words like "best", "worst", "most popular".
- Don't use any offensive term.
