# Cowgirl AI Core

Configures the assistant, assistant interface, vector, file management, directory and extension mechanisms


Development notes: 

+ Assistant should be created ahead of time if not already done so. 
+ If the vector already exists, it will not be created. 
+ Note: The vector only takes the 'latest' created vector.
+ Directory + ext should contain the full file path and all files you wish to upload
