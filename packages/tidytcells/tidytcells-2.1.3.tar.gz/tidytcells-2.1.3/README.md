`tidytcells` is a lightweight python package that cleans and standardizes T cell receptor (TR) and Major Histocompatibility (MH) data to be [IMGT](https://www.imgt.org/)-compliant.
The main purpose of the package is to solve the problem of parsing and collating together non-standardized TR datasets.
It is often difficult to compile TR data from multiple sources because the formats/nomenclature of how each dataset encodes TR and MH gene names are slightly different, or even inconsistent within themselves.
`tidytcells` can ameliorate this issue by auto-correcting and auto-standardizing your data.
Check out the [documentation page](https://tidytcells.readthedocs.io).
