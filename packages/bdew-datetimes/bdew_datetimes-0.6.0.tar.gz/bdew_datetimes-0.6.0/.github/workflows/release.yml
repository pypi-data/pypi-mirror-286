# This workflows will upload a Python Package to pypi using Twine when a release is created or modified (see trigger).
# To create a release:
# * open https://github.com/mj0nez/energy-datetime-utils/releases/new
# * create a new tag (preferably on main) with a semantic version e.g. 'v1.2.3' (the leading 'v' is important)
# * autogenerate release notes
# * publish release
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/en/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions#publishing-to-package-registries
