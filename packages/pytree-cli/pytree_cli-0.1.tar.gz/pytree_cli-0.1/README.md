# pytree

`pytree` is a CLI tool for printing a directory tree. Originally created to replicate the `tree` Unix command on Windows, and to display project directories in tutorials on [learndatasci.com](https://www.learndatasci.com) and [brmartin.com](https://brmartin.com)

## Installation

To install `pytree`, you can use `pip`:

```
pip install pytree
```

## Usage

```
pytree [directory] [options]
```

### Arguments

- `directory` (optional): The directory to start from. If not specified, the current directory is used by default.

### Options

- `-i`, `--ignore`: Ignore folders and files using glob patterns. You can specify multiple patterns to exclude.
- `-s`, `--sort`: Sort directory contents alphabetically.
- `-st`, `--style`: The style of lines to draw in the tree. Choices are:
    - `normal`: Standard line style (default). Ex: '│'
    - `heavy`: Heavy line style for a bolder look. Ex: '┃'
    - `double`: Double line style for fun. Ex: '║'
